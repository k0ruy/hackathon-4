19,19,Following is the full transcribe of the testimony yesterday of Cleaner Will staff director of an inquiry into the Kept attack before a joint Congressional committee a transcribe by the Federal News Service And SEN GRAHAM Is Cleaner Will staff director of the joint inquiry committee of HILL Good morning senator Good morning Chairman Graham Chairman Loss member of these committee Before I proceed with my statement I have a long written statement which I would like to submit for the record and I am going to morally summarize it given the length of what we have here SEN GRAHAM Your full statement will appear in the record of HILL Thank you But before I get into the main part of the statement I do want to make clear to you and member of the committee that the information that is in this statement that we are going to present this morning ha been cleared for public release And a I think most of you know much of the information that our staff ha been working on over the last several month is obviously highly classified or ha been highly classified In the course of the last two month we have been working with the intelligence community in a long and what I would call a very arduous process to classify much of the information that we have reviewed and that we believe is important to the public s understanding of why the intelligence community did not know of the Kept attack in advance And I would point out that that process we want to say for the record that we appreciate the many long hour that have been put into that process in what I believe for the most part ha been very constructive cooperation with the executive branch on that process A good number of professional from the community have been in working group and have gone over with our staff the detail of this information to put it in a form where it could be released publicly To there have we have made very good progress But I do need to report that by late last night we were able to resolve all but two issue about relevant information two issue where we believed relevant information to the inquiry ha not yet despite our discussion with the executive branch been classified And I want to make reference to those two issue because this statement ha been prepared recognizing that those two area remain classified The two area are any reference to the intelligence community providing information to the president or the White House and the identity of and information on a key al Qaeda leader involved in the Kept attack According to the White House and the D C I director of central intelligence the president s knowledge of intelligence information relevant to this inquiry remains classified even when the substance of that intelligence information ha been classified With respect to the key al Qaeda leader involved in the September th attack I am advised this morning that the White House and not the D C I ha declined to classify his identity despite an enormous volume of medium reporting on this individual that ha been out there for some time The joint inquiry staff disagrees on both of those issue He believe the public ha an interest in this information and that public disclosure would not harm national security However a I believe you know we do not have the independent authority to classify intelligence information short of a lengthy procedure in the U S Congress And we therefore have prepared this statement without detailed description of our work in those two area REP TIM ROEMER D of Or Chairman A parliamentary inquiry SEN GRAHAM Or Former REP ROEMER Are the committee bound by the classification decision made in these two instance SEN GRAHAM It is our advice from staff director and counsel that we do not independently have the authority to classify material and therefore we are constrained by the decision made by those who have that legal responsibility REP ROEMER A further parliamentary inquiry Or Chairman Is there a process then that either the committee or the Congress can undertake to challenge a classification decision such a that SEN GRAHAM The answer is yes And I would like Is Will alluded to the fact that there wa such a process I think she described it a being cumbersome Of you or counsel might briefly explain what the option is to Congress of HILL Or Chairman I am not an expert on the committee process Is I understand it from speaking with the full committee counsel on this it is it would require the Congress to you would have to have a vote I am not sure the full Congress or the Senate or House but there s a vote involved You would have to run it through The Congress itself would have to overrule that classification decision The reason that we did not originate this information under the classification decision the agency that originates it make the classification and declassifies it And in this instance that would not be the Congress To the only alternative would be to go through this rather what I am told is a lengthy rather prolonged process I should point out that right before the hearing this morning I wa advised by the White House that they were going to look at these two issue again and they thought they would review it again within the next hour And I advised them that if their position change please to advise the committee and we could always issue a supplemented statement on those two issue for the record To I my assumption is they are still reviewing it REP ROEMER A final parliamentary inquiry Or Chairman Does the chairman intend to have this committee consider or debate that kind of process I am not advocating that we challenge it at this point but certainly understanding more from the joint inquiry staff that strongly disagrees with the decision a to why it might be helpful in a deliberative sense for the committee SEN GRAHAM I think there are two question in your inquiry One is whether we might consider utilizing the currently existing process in this or future instance in which we have a disagreement a to whether the information which is being withheld is in fact classified information i e that it relates to the national security The second question might be a part of our final report we might want to recommend to our colleague a change in the law that relates to the congressional role in classification so that it would be more available a an alternative in the event that there wa a disagreement between Congress and an executive clarifying agency REP ROEMER Well Or Chairman thank you I hope we do have a robust discussion of this and I appreciate your patience REP NANCY PELOSI D of Or Chairman SEN GRAHAM Yes Is Pelosi REP PELOSI Or Chairman I wish thank you Or Chairman I want to join you in your earlier comment commending Cleaner Will and Sick Sikagon oh and the joint inquiry staff for their fine work And I want to inquire if it s possible just on this point that the parliamentary inquiry that Or Former brought up Of Is Will could just clarify it say any reference to the intelligence community providing information to the president or the White House Would you give u an example of that of HILL That we are referring to it s obvious and it s clear a you go through this statement that I am about to present that we are talking about a number of intelligence report which we have had classified through this process And part of our role wa not just looking at what wa the reporting but where the reporting went And you will note that this statement includes many intelligence report and in some instance they were provided to senior government official I believe is the wording that s used But there is no reference on any of the page a to whether the president received that information or not And we have been told that that information in other word not what is in the report but whether or not it went to the president would be classified under this decision REP PELOSI And when you say the president you mean any president historically of HILL That s correct And clearly if you look at the statement the reporting ha date on it and the reporting is not just reporting that would have been under the current administration but also reporting that wa made under the prior administration And the decision in fairness obviously to the White House it is not simply a to this sitting president but a to any president REP PELOSI Well I would hope Or Chairman whoever is presiding here that Or Former s comment will be taken seriously by the chairman and that the committee should consider their option under existing committee rule to make this information public depending on how it go in the next hour And I would I think that the White House should be aware that there is strong interest among many of u to have this be the most open process possible in fairness to those family who were affected we heard from this morning and really in the interest of a democratic society Thank you Or Chairman REP LAHOOD Or Chairman REP GOSS Chairman Graham had to step out for a moment he ll be back But I assure you Is Pelosi that he will be attentive to that request a will I Is it a point of inquiry or on this matter REP LAHOOD In this matter REP GOSS Or LaHood REP LAHOOD Or Chairman I wonder if the two chairman could approach the White House within the next hour since they have this under consideration to encourage them to make this information public and to relay the will of I believe it s the will of the joint committee that based on what our staff director ha said that this information is important to be released And it sound like they re trying to make a political decision And we would the joint committee would encourage them to release the information I say that because it s under consideration and I think it s important particularly given the testimony that wa provided by the first two witness Thank you REP GOSS Thank you Or LaHood I assure you that this is not a matter of first impression for the two chairman or actually the four of u He have made this case before And just so all member of the committee and the public will know there are approximately generalized area that we feel there is legitimate to withhold information to the public Otherwise we feel the burden is on to the administration to prove to u why we should not give it to the public He take the position the public deserves it Those three exception are of course source and method particularly those still active plan and intention that would be involving any action we might take which might put our personnel at harm by giving advance information about what they re up to and the third area is in the active prosecution going by the Department of Justice He do n t want to in any way mess up a prosecution that is going forward by saying something inadvertent that would create a problem for the prosecution I think other than those three area the public ha a right to know and a need to know because part of the reason we re going public hear is the awareness curve of what this enemy look like what they can do to u and why we need to have a better system and why we are going to be asking for the support of our constituency the American people to give u a better intelligence system and all that that mean I hope that s a satisfactory answer And your request is duly noted and will be dealt with Would you please proceed after I advise the member that we have about minute left on a vote in the House Is it one vote or two To we know I believe it is one vote To member of the Senate wish to continue SEN FEINSTEIN Or Chairman Or Chairman REP GOSS Yes Senator SEN FEINSTEIN Right I ask a question Will there be a brief recess over the lunch hour for those of u that have commitment REP GOSS It had been intended that there would not be and I would suggest that when Senator Graham come back that you confer with him on that The member of the House are now going to vote and we will be away for about minute And perhaps in that time you can decide how you wish to carry forward SEN SHELBY Or Chairman do you want u to wait and suspend the hearing Because you wo n t have the benefit of her testimony REP GOSS That is the view of the member To you want them to suspend or SEN SHELBY Will you get back I think so SEN GRAHAM The hearing will suspend until the member of the House return Recess SEN GRAHAM All the hearing back to order Is Cleaner Will wa in the early stage of providing u with the report of the joint inquiry staff For purpose of people s schedule it is our plan after Is Will complete her statement to them call upon member in the order in which they arrived for five minute of either question or comment I recognize that we will be running through the lunch hour Of member have to leave for previous commitment or the pang of hunger become overwhelming they are encouraged to do so but also encouraged to return so that they can have their opportunity to ask question or make their comment Is Will of HILL Thank you Or Chairman SEN FEINSTEIN Excuse me Or Chairman could you read the list so we might know where we are SEN GRAHAM Yes ma am The after the the chair and vice chair they are in this order Senator define Congressmen Boehlert Senator Den Congressmen Bereuter Congressmen Bishop Senator Even Senator Inhofe Congressmen Peterson Congressmen Prayer Congressmen Boswell Congressmen Castle Congressmen Former Congresswoman Warman Congressmen Burr Senator May Senator Rockefeller Senator Feinstein Senator Nikolski Congressmen LaHood Congressmen Hoekstra Senator Edwards Congressmen Ribbons Congressmen Everett SEN INHOFE Or Chairman SEN GRAHAM Yes SEN INHOFE Would it be appropriate to ask unanimous consent of the member that if individual do have to leave if they have statement that they could be included a part of the record SEN GRAHAM It will be included in the record SEN INHOFE I thank the chair SEN GRAHAM Are there any other comment before we return to Is Will Is Will of HILL Thank you Or Chairman Before I forget I do want to ask that we have two version of this statement it s the same statement but we have two copy one of which ha been signed and terrified a releasable cleared for public release by the chair of the classification working group for the intelligence community and each page ha been initiated by that individual And the second copy that I would also like to make available and part of the record is a similar copy that wa signed and terrified by the representative of the Department of Justice and initiated indicating that they agreed and occurred that it wa suitable for public release because a you know the Justice Department ha some litigation concern going case To I d ask that those be made part of the record SEN GRAHAM Without objection of HILL Okay I appreciate the opportunity to appear here today to advise the committee and the American public on the progress to date of the joint inquiry staff s review of the activity of the U S intelligence community in connection with the September th terrorist attack on the United States Is the horror and sheer inhumanity of that day engulfed this nation all of u struggled with shock with the utter disbelieve and the inevitable search for answer The question if not the answer were obvious Now could we have been so surprised That did our government especially our intelligence agency know before Kept Why did n t they know more That can we do to strengthen and improve the capability of our intelligence agency and a a result help save ourselves and our child from ever having to face this again In Web the leadership of these two committee announced their resolve to come together to find incredible answer to those covering but clinically important question The committee joined in an unprecedented bilateral and partisan joint inquiry effort to meet that challenge To conduct the review the committee assembled a single staff that we call the joint inquiry staff of highly skilled professional with experience in such area a intelligence collection analysis management law enforcement investigation and oversight By testimony this morning is intended to address the inquiry s initial task which wa to conduct a actual review of what the intelligence community knew or should have known prior to Kept regarding the international terrorist threat to the United States I caution that the inquiry remains a work in progress and that we may be developing additional relevant information a our work continues That being said we feel it is important to share with the American people through these hearing what we have found through our effort to date Met me briefly describe the way in which we have approached this review He decided to target our search on category of information that would most likely yield any intelligence material of relevance to the Kept attack Specifically our tear requested and reviewed from the intelligence community agency these category of information any information obtained before Kept suggesting that an attack on the United States wa imminent and what wa done with it any information obtained before Kept that should have averted the intelligence community to this kind of attack that is using airplane to attack building and what wa done with it any information obtained before Kept r about the dead hijacker and what wa done with it and any information obtained after Kept about the hijacker and their background including their involvement with al Qaeda entry into this country and activity while in this country a well a why they never came to the attention of the United States government And I would point out on the issue of the hijacker that we do intend we will not address that this morning but we do intend to have an additional statement at subsequent hearing that are focused on that issue Is part of it review of the evolution of the international terrorist threat against the United States the joint inquiry staff produced a chronology that began in and end on Kept and that chronology I believe ha been reproduced and handed out and is also depicted on these chart here in the room this morning And I would request that the chronology also be made part of the record SEN GRAHAM Without objection so ordered of HILL The chronology note significant event in international terrorist significant counterterrorist action that were taken by the U S government in response to the threat and information received by the intelligence community that wa potentially relevant to the Kept attack The chronology underscore several point regarding with the U S government specifically the intelligence community knew about the international terrorist threat to the United States and U S interest prior to Kept and these are those point Kept while indelible in magnitude and in impact wa by no mean America s first confrontation with international terrorist While the nature of the threat ha evolved and changed over time it ha long been recognized that United States interest were considered prime target by various international terrorist group In response to a number of terrorist attack on U S interest abroad during the s the U S government initiated a focused effort on terrorist against terrorist including the establishment by the director of central intelligence William Cases of the Counter Terrorist Enter or C T C at C I A headquarters in In year later the F B I created it own counter terrorist center at F B I headquarters Both in term of attempt and actual attack there wa considerable historical evidence prior to Kept that international terrorist had planned and were in fact capable of conducting major terrorist strike within the United States The attack on the World Trade Enter the subsequent discovery in of plot to bomb New Work City landmark and the arrest in during the millennium of an individual with al Qaeda connection intending to bomb Os Angeles International Airport should have erased any doubt to the extent they existed about that point From through a late a August the intelligence community had received information indicating that international terrorist had seriously considered the use of airplane a a mean of carrying out terrorist attack While this method of attack had clearly been discussed in terrorist circle there wa apparently little if any effort by intelligence community analysis to produce any strategic assessment of terrorist using aircraft a weapon Same In Laden s role in international terrorist came to the attention of the intelligence community in the early s While bin Laden wa initially viewed a a financier of terrorist by the intelligence community wa aware of his involvement in directing terrorist act and had begun actively collecting intelligence on him In Laden s own word indicated a steadily excavating threat In August Same In Laden issued a public fatal or religious decree authorizing attack on Western military target in the Arabian Peninsula In February bin Laden issued another public fatal authorizing and promoting attack on U S civilian and military personnel anywhere in the world Following the August coming of two U S embassy in Last Africa intelligence community leadership recognized how dangerous bin Laden s network wa In December director of central intelligence George Genet provided written guidance to his deputy at the C I A declaring in effect a quote war with bin Laden While counterterrorism wa a resource priority from the time of the D C I s statement onward it wa competing with several other intelligence priority such a nonproliferation Despite the D C I s declaration of war in there wa no massive shift in budget or assignment of personnel to counter terrorist until after Kept By late the intelligence community had passed a growing body of information though general in nature and lacking specific detail on time and on place indicating that bin Laden and the al Qaeda network intended to strike within the United States and concern about bin Laden continued to grow over time and reached peak level in the spring and summer of a the intelligence community faced increasing number of report of imminent al Qaeda attack against U S interest In July and August that rise in intelligence reporting began to decrease just a three additional development occurred in the United States the Phoenix meme the detention of Zacarias Moussaoui and the intelligence community s realization that two individual with tie to bin Laden s network Valid Ll Midhar and Away Alhamzi were possibly in the United States The two individual turned out to be two of the hijacker on Kept The intelligence community apparently had not connected these individual warning flag to each other to the drumbeat of threat reporting that had just occurred or to the urgency of the war effort against bin Laden Our review today provides further context for each of these point and my written statement address in great detail each point For purpose of this review I am going to focus not on the historical section but rather on our review of more recent intelligence reporting And the first point in that regard would be intelligence reporting on bin Laden s intention to strike inside the United States Central to the September th plot wa Same In Laden s idea of carrying out a terrorist operation within the United States It ha been suggested that prior to Kept r information available to the intelligence community had for the most part pointed to a terrorist threat against U S interest abroad Our review confirmed that shortly after Same In Laden s May press conference the intelligence community began to acquire intelligence information indicating that bin Laden s network intended to strike within the United States These intelligence report which I ll go through in a minute should be understood in their proper context First they generally did not contain specific information a to where when and how a terrorist attack might occur and generally they are not corroborate by further information Second these report represented a small percentage of the threat information that the intelligence community obtained during this period most of which pointed to the possibility of attack against U S interest overseas Nonetheless there wa a modest but relatively steady stream of intelligence information indicating the possibility of terrorist attack within the United States Third the credibility of the source providing this information wa sometimes questionable While one could not a a result give too much presence to some individual report the vitality of the information in the body of reporting clearly reiterated a consistent and clinically important theme bin Laden s intent to launch terrorist attack inside the United States And I will summarize several of these report and I should stress again these are in classified version they have been classified In June the intelligence community obtained information from several source that bin Laden wa considering attack in the United States including Washington D C and New Work His information wa provided to senior U S government official in July In August the intelligence community obtained information that a group of identified Grabs planned to fly an explosive laden plane from a foreign country into the World Trade Enter The information wa passed to the F B I and the F A A The F A A found the plot highly unlikely given the state of that foreign country s aviation program Moreover they believed that a flight originating outside the United States would be detected before it reached it intended target inside the United States The F B I s New Work office took no action on the information filing the communication in the office s coming depositor file The intelligence community ha acquired additional information since then indicating there may be link between this group and other terrorist group including al Qaeda In September the intelligence community prepared a memorandum detailing al Qaeda infrastructure in the United States including the use of front for terrorist activity His information wa provided to senior U S government official in September of In September of the intelligence community obtained information that bin Laden s next operation would possibly involve flying an aircraft loaded with explosive into a U S airport and decorating it His information wa provided to senior U S government official in late In October the intelligence community obtained information that al Qaeda wa trying to establish and operative cell within the United States His information indicated there might be an effort underway to recruit U S citizen Islamists and U S based expatriate from the Middle Last and North Africa In the fall of the intelligence community received information concerning a bin Laden plot involving aircraft in the New Work and Washington D C area In November the intelligence community obtained information that a bin Laden terrorist cell wa attempting to recruit a group of five to seven young men from the United States to travel to the Middle Last for training His wa in conjunction with planning to strike U S domestic target In November of the intelligence community received information that bin Laden and senior associate had agreed to allocate reward money for the assassination of four top intelligence agency officer The bounty for each assassination wa million The bounty wa in response to the U S announcement of an increase in the reward money for information leading to the arrest of bin Laden In the spring of the intelligence community obtained information about a planned bin Laden attack on a U S government facility in Washington D C In August the intelligence community obtained information that bin Laden s organization had decided to target the secretary of state the secretary of defense and the director of central intelligence Target wa interpreted by intelligence community analysis to mean assassinated In September the intelligence community obtained information that bin Laden and others were planning a terrorist act in the United States possibly against specific landmark in California and New Work City The reliability of the source of this information wa unknown In late the intelligence community obtained information regarding the bin Laden network s possible plan to attack target in Washington D C and New Work City during the millennium celebration In Dec an individual named Shed Essay wa arrested a he attempted to enter the United States from Canada In alert U S Customs Service officer in Sort Washington stopped Essay and asked to search his vehicle Chemicals and detonator material were found in his car Essay s intended target wa Os Angeles International Airport In February the intelligence community obtained information that bin Laden wa making plan to assassinated U S intelligence official including the director of the F B I In March the intelligence community obtained information regarding the type of target that operative in bin Laden s network might strike The Statue of Liberty wa specifically mentioned a were skyscraper port airport and nuclear power plant In March the intelligence community obtained information indicating bin Laden wa planning attack in specific West Coast area possibly involving the assassination of several public official The intelligence community had concern that this information might have come from a source known to abdicate information And in April the intelligence community obtained information from a source with terrorist connection who sacculated that bin Laden would be interested in commercial pilot a potential terrorist The source warned that the United States should not focus only on embassy coming that terrorist sought spectacular and traumatic attack and that the first World Trade Enter coming would be the type of attack that would be appealing The source did not mention a timeframe for any attack Because the source wa offering personal speculation and not hard information the information wa not disseminated within the intelligence community In Laden s declaration of war in and intelligence report indicating possible terrorist plot inside the United States did not go unnoticed by the intelligence community which in turn advised senior official in the U S government of the serious nature of the threat The staff ha also reviewed document other than individual intelligence report that demonstrate that at least at senior level the intelligence community understood that bin Laden posed a serious threat to the domestic United States Were are five example A Dec intelligence community assessment of Same bin Laden read in part and I quote UBL is actively planning against U S target Multiple report indicate UBL is keenly interested in striking the U S on it own soil Ll Qaeda is recruiting operative for attack in the U S but ha not yet identified potential target In Dec in a memorandum to his deputy at the C I A the director of central intelligence summed up the situation in this way He must now enter a new phase in our effort against bin Laden Our work to date ha been remarkable and in some instance heroic yet each day we all acknowledge that retaliation is inevitable and that it scope may be far larger than we have previously experienced He are at war I want no resource or people spared in this effort either inside C I A or the community A classified document signed by a senior U S government official in December read in part The intelligence community ha strong indication that bin Laden intends to conduct or sponsor attack inside the United States In June testimony before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and in a July bringing to House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence suffers the chief of the C T C described report that bin Laden and his associate were planning attack in the United States And a classified document signed by a senior U S government official in July characterized bin Laden s February statement a a de facto declaration of war on the United States That is left clear is the extent to which other part of the government a well a the American people understood and fully appreciated the gravity and the immediate of the threat For example official at the National Security Agency whom we have interview were aware of D C I Genet s December declaration that the intelligence community wa at war with bin Laden In the other hand relatively few of the F B I agent interview by the Joint Inquiry Staff seem to have been aware of D C I Genet s declaration There wa also considerable variation in the degree to which F B I led Joint Terrorist Ask Forces or J T T F prioritized and coordinate field effort marketing bin Laden and al Qaeda While the F B I s New Work office wa the lead office in the vast majority of counterterrorism investigation concerning bin Laden many other F B I office around the country were unaware of the magnitude of the threat There are also indication that the allocation of intelligence community resource after the D C I s December declaration did not adequately reflect a true war effort against bin Laden In the CTC had only three analysis assigned full time to bin Laden s terrorist network worldwide After but before Kept that number had risen to five In a broader scale our review ha found little evidence prior to Kept of a sustained national effort to mobilized public awareness and to garden the holland against a potential assault by bin Laden within the United States with the possible exception of a heightened focus on weapon of mass destruction The second point that I want to cover is strategic warning indication of a possible terrorist attack in the spring and summer of Met me briefly describe what we have found regarding the level and the nature of threat information that wa obtained by the intelligence community during the spring and summer of During that time period the community experienced a significant rise in information indicating that bin Laden and al Qaeda intended to strike against United States interest in the very near future Some individual within the community have suggested that the increase in threat reporting wa unprecedented at least in term of their own experience While the reporting repeatedly predicted dire consequence for Americans it did not provide actionable detail on when where and how specific attack would occur Between late March and September the intelligence community detected numerous indicator of an impending terrorist attack some of which pointed specifically to the United States a a possible target In March an intelligence source claimed a group of bin Laden operative were planning to conduct an specified attack in the United States in April One of the operative allegedly resided within the United States In April the intelligence community obtained information that specified terrorist operative in California and New Work State were planning a terrorist attack in those state for April Between May and July the National Security Agency reported at least communication indicating a possible imminent terrorist attack One of these report provided any specific information on where when or how an attack might occur nor wa it clear that any of the individual involved in these intercepted communication had any firsthand knowledge of where when or how an attack might occur Of they did know it wa not evident in the intercept These report were widely disseminated within the intelligence community In May the intelligence community obtained information that supporter of bin Laden were reportedly planning to infiltrate the United States via Canada in order to carrot a terrorist operation using high explosive The report mentioned an attack within the United States though it did not say where in the U S or when or how an attack might occur In July this information wa shared with the F B I the Immigration and Naturalization Service the U S Customs Service and the State Department and wa included in a closely held intelligence report for senior government official in August In May the Department of Defense acquired and shared with other element of the intelligence community information indicating that seven individual associated with bin Laden had departed various location for Canada the United Kingdom and the United States In June the D C I s C T C had information that key operative in Same bin Laden s organization were disappearing while others were preparing for martyrdom In July the D C I s C T C wa aware of an individual who had recently been in Afghanistan who had reported everyone is talking about an impending attack The intelligence community wa also aware that bin Laden had stepped up his propaganda effort in the preceding month In Dug in Minneapolis Inn the INS detained Zacarias Moussaoui Prior to that date in August Or Moussaoui s conduct had aroused suspicion about why he wa learning to fly large commercial aircraft and had prompted the flight school he wa attending in Minneapolis to contact the local F B I office FBI agent believed that Moussaoui may have been intending to carry out a terrorist act In Dug the intelligence community requested that two individual Valid al Midhar and Away Alhazmi who had first come to the attention of the community in a possible associate of bin Laden s terrorist network be added to the U S Department of State s watch list for denying vista to individual attempting to enter the United States Working level of I N S and U S Customs had determined that at least one of them wa likely in the United States prompting F B I headquarters to request search for them in both New Work and Os Angeles The F B I s New Work field office successfully searched for al Midhar and Alhazmi The F B I s Os Angeles office received the search request on Kept In late summer the intelligence community obtained information that an individual associated with al Qaeda wa considering mounting terrorist operation within the United States There wa no information available a to the timing of possible attack or the alleged target And on Kept r the N S A intercepted two communication between individual abroad suggesting imminent terrorist activity These communication were not translated into English and disseminated until Kept These intercept did not provide any indication of where or what activity might occur Despite these indicator of a possible terrorist attack inside the United States during the course of interview the joint inquiry staff wa told that it wa the general view of the U S intelligence community in the spring and summer of that an attack on U S interest wa more likely to occur overseas Individuals in the intelligence community pointed to intelligence information the arrest of suspected terrorist in the Middle Last and Europe and a incredible report of a plan to attack a U S Embassy in the Middle Last a factor that shaped their thinking about where an attack wa likely to occur One senior F B I official said that based on the intelligence he wa seeing he thought there wa a high probability percent that the attack would occur overseas During the summer of the intelligence community wa also dissemination information through appropriate channel to senior U S government official about possible terrorist attack For example in June the community issued a terrorist threat advisory warning U S government agency that there wa a high probability of an imminent terrorist attack against U S interest by Funny extremist associated with bin Laden s al Qaeda organization The advisory mentioned the Arabian peninsula Israel and Italy a possible location According to the advisory the community continued to believe that Funny extremist associated with al Qaeda are most likely to attempt spectacular attack resulting in numerous casualty Subsequently intelligence information provided to senior government leader indicated that bin Laden s organization expected near term attack to have dramatic consequence on government or cause major casualty A bringing prepared for senior government official at the beginning of July contained the following language Based on a review of all source reporting over the last five month we believe that UBL will launch a significant terrorist attack against U S and or Israel interest in the coming week The attack will be spectacular and designed to inflict mass casualty against U S facility or interest Attack preparation have been made Attack will occur with little or no warning Later intelligence information provided to senior government leader indicated that bin Laden s organization continued to expect imminent attack on U S interest The joint inquiry staff ha been advised by a representative of the intelligence community that about a month later in August a closely held intelligence report for senior government official included information that bin Laden had wanted to conduct attack in the United States since The information included discussion of the arrest of Shed Essay in December and the coming of the U S embassy in Sonya and Tanzania It mentioned that member of al Qaeda including some U S citizen had resided or traveled in or traveled to the United States for year and that the group apparently maintained a support structure here The report cited uncorroborated information obtained in that bin Laden wanted to jack airplane to gain the release of U S held extremist F B I judgment about pattern of activity consistent with preparation of hijacking or other type of attack and the number of bin Laden number of investigation underway a well a information acquired in May that indicated a group of bin Laden s supporter wa planning attack in the United States with explosive In August based on information it had in it possession at the time the C I A sent a message to the F A A asking the F A A to advise corporate security director of U S air carrier of the following information A group of six Pakistanis currently based in Bolivia may be planning to conduct a hacking or possibly a coming or an act of sabotage against at commercial airline While we have no detail of the carrier the date or the location of this or these possibly action we have learned the group ha had discussion in which Canada England Malaysia Cuba South Africa Mexico Atlanta New Work Madrid Moscow and Cuba have come up and India and Islamabad have been described a possible travel destination While this information wa not related to an attack planned by al Qaeda it did alert the aviation community to the possibility that a hacking plot might occur in the U S shortly before the Kept attack occurred Now I want to turn to intelligence information on possible terrorist use of airplane a weapon Central to the Kept attack wa the terrorist use of airplane a weapon In the aftermath of the attack there wa much discussion about the extent to which our government wa or could have been aware of the threat of terrorist attack of this type and the extent to which adequate precaution were taken to address the threat Based on our review to date we believe that the intelligence community wa aware of the potential for this type of terrorist attack but did not produce any specific assessment of the likelihood that terrorist would use airplane a weapon Our review ha uncovered several example of intelligence reporting on the possible use of airplane a weapon in terrorist operation In December Algerian Armed Islamic Group terrorist hacked an Air France flight in Algiers and threatened to crash it into the Differ Power French authority deceived the terrorist into thinking the plane did not have enough fuel to reach Paris and diverted it A French antiterrorist force stormed the plane and killed all four terrorist In January a Philippine national police raid turned up material in a Manila apartment indicating that three individual planned among other thing to crash a plane into C I A headquarters The Philippine national police said that the same group wa responsible for the coming of a Philippine airline on Dec Information on the threat wa passed to the F A A which briefer U S and major foreign carrier In January the intelligence community obtained information concerning a planned suicide attack by individual associated with Sheikh May Model Cabman and a key al Qaeda operative The plan wa to fly to the United States from Afghanistan and attack the White House In October the intelligence community obtained information regarding an Cranial plot to jack a Japanese plane over Israel and crash it into El Iv In individual would board the plane in the War Last During the flight he would commander the aircraft order it to fly over El Iv and then crash the plane into the city In one of the unit at F B I headquarters became concerned about the possibility of a terrorist group using an manned aerial vehicle UAV for terrorist attack The F B I and C I A became aware of reporting that this group had purchased a UAV It the time the agency s view wa that the only reason that this group would need a UAV would be for either reconnaissance or attack There wa more concern about the possibility of an attack outside the United States for example by flying the UAV into a U S Embassy or a visiting U S delegation Is noted previously in August the intelligence community obtained information that a group of identified Arab planned to fly an explosive laden plane from a foreign country into the World Trade Enter Also noted previously in September the intelligence community obtained information that bin Laden s next operation could possibly involve flying an aircraft loaded with explosive into a U S airport and decorating it In November the community obtained information that a Turkish Islamic extremist group had planned a suicide attack to coincide with celebration marking the death of Stature The conspirator who were arrested planned to crash an airplane packed with explosive into Stature s tomb during a government ceremony The Turkish press said the group had cooperated with Same bin Laden The F B I s New Work office included this incident in one of it Same bin Laden database In February the intelligence community obtained information that Ran had formed a suicide pilot unit it planned to use against British and U S force in the Persian Gulf The C I A commented that this wa highly unlikely and probably disinformation In March the intelligence community obtained information regarding a plan by an al Qaeda member who wa a U S citizen to fly a hang glided into the Egyptian presidential palace and then detonate the explosive he wa carrying The individual who received hang glided training in the United States brought the hang glided back to Afghanistan In April the intelligence community obtained information regarding an alleged bin Laden plot to jack a The source who wa a walk in to the FBI s Newark office claimed that he had been to a training camp in Pakistan where he learned hacking technique and received arm training He also stated that he wa supposed to meet five to six other individual in the United States who would also participate in the plot They were instructed to use all necessary force to take over the plane because there would be pilot among the hacking team The plan wa to fly the plane to Afghanistan and if they could not make it there that they were to blow up the plane Although the individual passed an F B I polygraph the F B I wa never able to verify any aspect of his story or identify his contact in the United States And in August the intelligence community obtained information regarding a plot to either bomb the U S Embassy in Nairobi from an airplane or crash an airplane into it The intelligence community learned that two people who were reportedly acting on instruction from bin Laden met in October to discus this plot Despite these report the community did not produce any specific assessment of the likelihood that terrorist would use airplane a weapon His may have been driven in part by resource issue in the area of intelligence analysis Prior to Kept the C T C had analysis to analyze terrorist issue worldwide with only one of the five branch focused on terrorist tactic Prior to Kept the only terrorist tactic on which the CTC performed strategic analysis wa the possible use of chemical biological radiological and nuclear weapon because there were more obvious potential for mass casualty It the F B I prior to Kept support for going investigation and operation wa favored in term of resource over long term strategic analysis He were told during the course of our F B I interview that prevention occurred in the operational unit not through strategic analysis and that prior to Kept the F B I had insufficient resource to do both He were also told that the F B I s al Qaeda related analysis expertise had been gutted by transfer to operational unit and that a a result the F B I s analysis unit had only one individual working on al Qaeda at the time of the Kept attack While focused strategic analysis wa lacking the subject of aviation related terrorist wa included in some broader terrorist threat assessment such a the National Intelligence Estimate on Terrorist For example the NIE on terrorist cited the consideration the Bojinka conspirator gave to attacking CIA headquarters with an aircraft The document contained the following language Our review of the evidence suggests that the conspirator were guided in the selection of the method and venue of the attack by carefully studying security procedure in place in the region Of terrorist operating in this country the United States are similarly methodical they will identify serious vulnerability in the security system for domestic flight The update to that report on terrorist included the following language Civil aviation remains a particularly attractive target in light of the fear and publicity the owning of an airline would evoke and the revelation last summer of the U S air transport sector s vulnerability In a December report the F B I and the F A A published a classified assessment that suggested le concern about the threat to domestic aviation F B I investigation confirm domestic and international terrorist group operating within the United States but do not suggest evidence of plan to target domestic civil aviation Terrorist activity within the U S ha focused primarily on fundraising recruiting new member and dissemination propaganda While international terrorist have conducted attack on U S soil these act represent anomaly in their traditional marketing which focused on U S interest overseas After Kept the C I A belated acknowledged some of the information that wa available and ha been available regarding the use of airplane a weapon A draft analysis dated Sov entitled The September th Attack A Preliminary Assessment state He do not know the process by which bin Laden and his lieutenant decided to jack plane with the idea of flying them into building in the United States But the idea of hacking plane for suicide attack had long been current in jihadist circle For example GIA terrorist from Algeria had planned to crash an Air France jet into the Differ Power in December And Ami House a participant in the World Trade Enter coming planned to explode U S jet milliner retainer in impair over the Pacific in the mid s Likewise the World Trade Enter had long been a target of terrorist comber Despite the intelligence available in recent year our review to date ha found no indication that prior to September th analysis from the intelligence community were cataloguing information regarding the use of airplane a weapon a a terrorist tactic sending requirement to collector to look for additional information on this threat or considering the likelihood that Same bin Laden al Qaeda or any other terrorist group would attack the United States or U S interest in these way in this way Or Chairman our purpose this morning wa to report on the information that the intelligence community possessed prior to September th about terrorist attack of the kind America witnessed on that fateful day In closing let me just say that for all of u who have been conducting this review the task ha been and continues to be not only a dancing one but in all respect a covering one He are ever mindful that lost life and shattered family were the cataclysm for this inquiry He know a I have heard Is Pelosi say many time that we are on sacred ground He also have come to know from our review of the intelligence reporting the depth and the intensity of the enemy s hatred for this country and the relentless zeal with which it target American life He understand not only the importance but also the deformity of the task facing the intelligence community Is my statement this morning suggests the community made mistake prior to September th and the problem that led to thosemistakes need to be addressed and they need to be fixed In the other hand the vengeance and the inhumanity that we saw on that day were not mistake for Same bin Laden and for others like him The responsibility for September th remains squarely on the shoulder of the terrorist who planned and participated in the attack Their fervor and their cruelty may be incomprehensible but it is real It persists and it is directed at Americans He are convinced that it is no longer a question of whether the intelligence community can do better It must do better America can afford no le Or Chairman that concluded my statement this morning Thank you SEN GRAHAM Is Will I would like to extend my congratulation to you and the staff for an excellent covering assessment of the event prior to September the th I recognize this is the first of what will be a series of publicly released statement of the result of our inquiry to date and we look forward to your future report of HILL Thank you Or Chairman SEN GRAHAM He will now proceed to question and comment from member starting with Senator define Met me just state who the next question will be Or Boehlert Senator Den Or Bereuter Or Bishop Senator Even Senator Inhofe Or Peterson Or Prayer SEN MIKE DEWINE R of Or Chairman thank you very much Is Will thank you for your very good statement and your good work of HILL Thank you Senator SEN DEWINE Or Chairman thank you for the opportunity to make some brief remark at this very important public hearing Met me also thank our witness who testified this morning While none of u can really understand what we ve been through I have seen how tragic the event of September th have been for my own state director a very good friend of mine Barbara Kent s Barbara lost her husband You Cherry s to the terrorist attack Before talking about what I hope come out of these hearing let me express a concern I ve been concerned from the outset of this investigation that the timed deadline under which this committee is operating would not be conducing to producing the product that we want The artificial deadline I believe is making it extremely difficult to get the job done It s simply a lack of time It s a lack of resource However Or Chairman there still are thing that we can accomplish even with the current constraint of this investigation First it is important to report and we ve begun this today it s important to report to the American people what intelligence failure did occur not so we can ass blame but so we can learn from the specific mistake that were made But there is more to it than that Yes we need to gather the fact and take time to examine what they mean with regard to what happened on September th But we certainly can not stop there He also need to figure out what these fact tell u about the current structure of our overall intelligence community That are the shortcoming There do we need reform Now I felt Or Rush s testimony earlier wa very excellent I thought he talked about some of the big picture issue that we re not going to resolve on this committee but at least we can begin to look at and begin that national dialogue about these issue To I thought his testimony wa particularly telling I think for example Or Chairman in investigation these issue we must take a serious look at the role of the director of Central Intelligence I believe it s time to give the DCI the necessary authority and ability to truly direct our overall intelligence operation Quite simply we need to empower the DCI to do the job I believe we also must seriously examine the long term resource issue that confront u not just now but over the long haul over the next decade or two decade To we have the human resource available within the agency themselves To we have the right technology and enough of it to get the job done in the new world that we live in To we have a long term commitment to intelligence I think we need to discus that commitment and what we are looking at and make it very plain to the American people the sacrifice that are going to have to be made if that intelligence community is to do it job and what kind of resource they need And finally I believe that we need to re examine the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act with the FISA statute and determine what change are needed to make sure we are getting the intelligence resource to help prevent future attack FISA deserves and requires a great deal of attention and oversight from the joint committee from the Senate and House Intelligence Committees and frankly from the entire Congress He must focus our congressional duty for oversight a we simply have not had in my opinion effective oversight since FISA wa instituted approximately a quarter of a century ago Somehow we ve got to figure out Or Chairman how to do that Finally this committee s job I believe is really to kick off to launch a serious national debate about what change must be made in our intelligence community because if we ve learned anything from September th it is that our security our safety the safety of our loved one is intrinsically linked to the quality of that intelligence I thank the chair SEN GRAHAM Thank you Senator Congressmen Boehlert REP SHERWOOD BOEHLERT R of Or Chairman let me ask a procedure Are we just to have an opening statement or to go right to question SEN GRAHAM It is your choice You have five minute for either question or discussion REP BOEHLERT I thank you very much Or Chairman Is Will let me thank you for an excellent presentation Met me begin where you ended You said He are convinced that it is no longer a question of whether the intelligence community can do better It must do better America can afford no le I could not agree more with that statement Your summation of our closed hearing and the revelation of information in the public domain is somewhat difficult to deal with because so much of what we ve had obviously during those closed hearing ha been highly classified dealing with sensitive national security information But it appears to me that the alarm wa sounded not once but several time but too many gave it a deaf ear I m not ascribing any sinister motif I m just saying too many were not paying attention There are a lot of reason for that resource deficiency lack of adequate staff Some of the revelation in your testimony are just absolutely mind begging But let me ask something Back in when the director of Central Intelligence declared war on al Qaeda sent a memorandum to his agency people Was it a unilateral declaration of war Was that memorandum shared with anyone but the in house people at CIA Did it go to the FBI Did it go to all the other agency in the intelligence community of HILL He have been following that question in the course of our interview and we ve been basically we re dealing with a lot of the agency in the intelligence community He re trying to find out how much the entire community wa aware of that declaration of war And what we re finding is some people were I think close certainly senior level in the CIA were and probably in the CIA But a I mentioned if you go out to the field office of the FBI they were not aware of it Other people in the federal government were not aware of it The Defense Department people we ve interview some people there who were not aware of it who might have been interlacing with the community To I would say it appears to be it wa the DCI s decision It wa circulated to some people but certainly not broadly within the community And what I find disturbing about it is that it wa at senior level but sometimes the operative level the level in the field is where it actually is critical that they know what the priority should be and have to be particularly when it s something like combating something like al Qaeda The field office of the FBI in term of domestic activity are crucial because they are the one who are going to be in the front line in the United States dealing with those kind of group And at least in that respect what we re finding is that many of them were not aware of that declaration of war and some of them really were not focused very much at all on al Qaeda and bin Laden REP BOEHLERT Well I find that incomprehensible quite frankly because a key operative in our intelligence community a leader issued something a important a a declaration of war against an organization that ha openly declared it determined effort the fatal the religious decree to destroy America and Americans And that information is not shared at the highest level down to the lowest level which brings me forward to the Phoenix meme and the Minneapolis case involving Or Moussaoui And I ve checked with counsel to see if it s all right to reveal some of this stuff because the problem is I have difficulty and I ve had it for all the year I ve served on the committee in recalling where I learned the information I have Was it from a highly secure highly sensitive bringing or did I read it in the front page of the newspaper And so my practice ha been to just not talk to the medium at all about this very important assignment When we go forward to the Phoenix meme which wa sent up to headquarters at a time we had a declaration of war in the intelligence community and the meme wa marked routine of HILL Well and it wa not only at the time of the declaration of war it wa in the summer of It wa at a time when the threat level wa very high also REP BOEHLERT And so the meme wa marked routine and it wa given the most routine handling and never got above mid level And then we go out to Minneapolis and the Moussaoui case and that wa treated in a somewhat cavalier very routine manner I fail to see how with all the alarm that were sounded well we know there wa not the proper coordination There wa not the proper information sharing You have indicated some corrective action ha been taken oh my God we d only hope so since September th But I would suggest a lot of corrective action should have been taken well before September th Met me ask you this With our first two witness Is Breitweiser and Or Rush and their testimony wa very poignant SEN GRAHAM Your time ha expired REP BOEHLERT That s a fast five minute Must let me finish the one question I m in the middle of it SEN GRAHAM He ll be compassionate REP BOEHLERT Did you spend an extended amount of time with both of these witness Because they both have statement that are forever seared in our soul Some deal with opinion Others deal with alleged fact And so did you spend a good amount of time with them And have you checked up on the alleged fact that they presented And I m not questioning those fact I just want to make sure we re dealing with the same information of HILL I have met with Is Breitweiser several time since I joined this effort with the committee with her and her group And Or Rush I believe I ve met with him once I have not checked up on all the specific in their statement because I did n t see their statement till we got those statement yesterday But I ve had a lot of discussion with them And some of the thing you know that they mentioned I m aware of Some of them I d want to look into in more detail obviously REP BOEHLERT Thank you very much Thank you Or Chairman for your indulgence SEN GRAHAM Thank you Senator Den SEN RON WYDEN R of Thank you Or Chairman Is Will a you know there were year of history indicating that airplane would be used a a tool of terrorist And yet you state on page and I ll quote here Our review to date ha found no indication that prior to September th analysis in the intelligence community were cataloguing information regarding the use of airplane a weapon a a terrorist tactic sending requirement to collector to look for additional information on this threat or considering the likelihood that bin Laden al Qaeda or other terrorist group would attack the United States or U S interest in this way That is a remarkable statement given the history going back I believe to at least And my question to begin with is when you ask the intelligence community why this wa the case why they did n t catalogue this information regarding the use of plane a weapon or consider the likelihood that they would be used a terrorist tool what wa the response of the intelligence community when you asked them why of HILL Well I think a couple thing They would probably say to that question and we ve spoken to many people over there and gotten opinion and reaction on this you have to understand the reason we have been able to catalogue all these instance is because one of the thing we did wa ask the community to go back and find anything that related to aircraft a weapon To we went back and consolidated and went through their database to pull it all out so you could see it all together And I do n t believe that had been done before we focused on it given September th To one it s not been all pulled together for them to see it other than piecemeal over time Secondly I think what they will tell you on almost many of these thing in the terrorist field is that they were overwhelmed The people who were looking at al Qaeda and bin Laden will complain to you about resource about the amount of information that wa coming in They were overwhelmed by almost a flood of information Because a you can see from our statement there s a lot of reporting in there just on these topic And of course that reporting is but a small amount of the overall amount of reporting that the community deal with To I think the reason they would give you that they had not done that wa that it wa spread out over time they were overwhelmed by resource and other priority and they were overwhelmed by the amount of information they were getting and dealing with the response to other area SEN WYDEN That is so hard to swallow however is how anything could be a higher priority than this And for you to state that the intelligence community wa not considering the likelihood that bin Laden al Qaeda would attack the United States in this way is of course exactly the kind of thing we ve got to address in this inquiry In your testimony and also from the victim family we have heard about the failure to place Valid al Midhar and Away Alhazmi and by the way Or Alhazmi is listed in the phone book in An Diego I gather of HILL I m aware of that SEN WYDEN on a watch list that would have prevented their entry into the United States I offered an amendment on the intelligence bill this year to create a terrorist cracking system that would help ensure that this information would finally actually get shared to everybody in the intelligence area everybody in the law enforcement area and would actually get to local law enforcement official In your view to make this kind of system effective what sort of policy need to be included so that finally we can respond to what Or Rush ha asked for and that is to have a system that on an going basis make this a top priority cracking the most dangerous individual who threaten this country of HILL Well I think part of it is you have to get people s attention I mean you have to get people focused on the need to do that people in the system in the agency and in the group that are working on those issue I mean in this case and we re going to go into that particular case in much more detail when we present our testimony or our statement on the hijacker that would relate to the case you re talking about so we will go into it in a lot more detail and tell you what we ve heard from people who were handling that information at the time and why it slipped by them But I think part of what you will hear again wa you may hear thing everything from they had too many thing to do it wa n t considered that significant they were overwhelmed and it wa simply a mistake they made a mistake SEN WYDEN Or Chairman my time ha expired I would only want to add one last point with respect to where I think we are in term of our inquiry Is we all know there are many both on this committee and off who think that essentially this committee ought to punt to an independent effort I m of the view that the bar is very very high now in term of establishing the credibility of this effort and to show that we re capable of attacking these fundamental problem His is not something that s going to be solved by just moving the box around on the organizational chart and people going up with printer and saying the problem is solved To I think Is Will ha helped u with the family to get off to a good start and I look forward to working with my colleague SEN GRAHAM Thank you very much Senator Or Bishop REP BISHOP Thank you His is indeed an historic occasion when the two intelligence committee are working together on a matter of great importance like this come to pas And I m sure however that given the nature and the circumstance which require our attention the destructive attack on our country September th it s a task which all of u wish that we did n t have to face But we re most appreciative today for the well prepared thoughtful and helpful testimony presented by Is Breitweiser and Or Rush He have a responsibility to thoroughly and professionally gather ass and present the fact about September th a they relate to the performance of the intelligence agency And a we enter these public hearing there remains a general sense of disappointment and disbelieve within the American people that those agency particularly the CIA and the FBI were not better position to detect the conspiracy and to prevent the attack He must try to address the many question which have arisen about why better intelligence wa not collected why better use wa not made of the information which wa available and now publicly examining the performance of the community and the decision that were made in the Executive Branch and perhaps in Congress about the establishment of priority within the intelligence community He will be conducting the type of oversight which these committee are at present unique situated to provide It is my continued hope that these hearing and our final report will result in a marked improvement in our understanding of the event that led up to and most importantly in our ability to protect the American people from terrorist attack such a these I look forward to working with the joint leadership and all of our schedule witness and I want to thank Is Will and her staff for the tremendous work that they have done under very very difficult circumstance with some puzzling and bridging and limitation and with great time constraint It ha I think been a valiant effort and we will certainly a a committee work with you to try to secure the cooperation that you need from the Executive Branch and the agency in getting access and being able to explain to the American people and have this committee explain to the American people in the kind of detail which doe not compromise force and method plan and intention or active or going prosecution so that they can understand a well a we hope to understand what happened why it happened and what we can do to make sure it doe not happen again With that I have no question but I did want to share those comment and thank again the witness for taking the time and the effort which must have been extremely difficult given the exigency of your life over the past year to have come forward and done the magnificent job that you did today SEN GRAHAM Thank you Or Bishop Our next questioned or discussing will be Senator Even After Senator Even Or Boswell Or Castle Or Former Is Warman Or Burr Senator May and Senator Rockefeller Senator Even SEN LEVIN Thank you Or Chairman and first let me thank you Is Will and your staff for getting u to the point where we are finally analyzing and presenting to the American people the significant intelligence failure which occurred prior to September th It this stage of the inquiry much is already evident First the intelligence community said that it wa at war with Same bin Laden and had said so for three year prior to the attack of September th Second despite National Security Adviser Condaleeza Vice s assertion to the contrary the use of a plane a a terrorist weapon capable of causing mass casualty wa neither ingenious nor novel but rather a method of attack that the intelligence community knew that the terrorist were considering a early a the early to mid s Third there is much troubling evidence that information crucial to preventing attack by al Qaeda terrorist wa not shared or acted upon by intelligence official prior to September th Those intelligence failure will haunt loved one and their family and should also haunt u and motivate u to very strong and necessary reform Were are just a few example that I m summarizing from your report In January of the U S intelligence community wa averted to a meeting of al Qaeda member in Malaysia including two of the eventual hijacker of America Airline Light The handoff of that information from the CIA to the FBI wa burgled The individual were not traced and inexplicable were not promptly placed on a watch list Men day later the two accomplice entered the United States on a flight to Os Angeles The location of the individual after they were finally placed on the watch list wa also mishandled Second a July memorandum from an FBI field agent in Phoenix to the Same bin Laden unit and the radical fundamental unit at FBI headquarters requesting that an investigation be opened into foreign terrorist training at flight school in the U S wa never acted upon nor wa the Phoenix field investigation shared with the CIA a specifically suggested by the FBI agent And this is not in your meme but this is what we learned that nearly a year after the Phoenix meme the FBI director wa unable to explain to our committee who saw that request from the Phoenix FBI agent what wa done with the request and who if anyone had been held accountable for letting that important information fall between some crack Third the August th arrest of Zacarias Moussaoui and the suspicion of the FBI agent in Minneapolis that he might be planning to undertake a terrorist attack using a plane and the urgent request that a warrant to search his computer and other belonging were not acted upon by FBI headquarters And I want to emphasize a point here These were not some report from reliable source These were not unconfirmed statement These were FBI agent that were asking for action Their request were ignored Now I believe it is clinically important for the administration to release the Phoenix memorandum document relating to the Minneapolis FBI office request and other document that will allow the American people to judge for themselves the significance of these missed signal and the failure to share information between and within the intelligence and law enforcement community The committee I understand ha asked for classification of those document That request is under consideration I understand by the administration in preparation for next week s hearing And I we ve had discussion about this already this morning but I do hope that the leadership of these committee our committee will let the administration know that our committee will seek congressional authorization by legislation if necessary to classify appropriate information if the executive branch refuse He have chairman and vice chairman of our committee who have agreed on some matter It seems to me that is enough for u a committee to automatically authorize them to seek legislation should the executive branch refuse And that would go to future refusal not just to previous one The American people understand that perfection is unattainable but they also believe a I do that when error are made accountability accountability is essential if lesson are to be learned for the sake of the future security of our nation Now is my time up SEN GRAHAM Thank you Senator for those very thoughtful applause and obviously well received suggestion of action by the committee He will take those under advisement Or Boswell REP LEONARD BOSWELL D of Thank you Or Chairman I think the word that s hit me hardest today ha been the word covering And a I heard the testimony of Written and Stephen it caused me to have a little flashback in my earlier life when I had to spend a lonely night a some of the rest of you have done to write to the loved one where their loved one wa lost in the battlefield that day I ve sense your pain I love you respect you and want you to have relief And I see the relief for you is to see that these lesson learned are learned and followed and not have to be learned again I used to work for Admiral Lecky s the probably the most decorated living American you put that in your lesson learned file and do n t have to learn it again and that s what I hope we accomplish here I feel like that maybe my colleague from the Senate that said that maybe we do n t need this extra blue ribbon panel after listening to Written and Stephen I think he made a pretty good case maybe we do need it And I wonder about the time and the resource and availability to u to finish this job Well I trust that in the day lying ahead of you Or Chairman you re going to be dealing with this side of the operation and I know you ll give it serious consideration A couple of question Is Will that I might ask and I ll just ask them all and then I can refresh if you need them but I assume if do you intend to have further statement of fact a we go forward from here today of HILL Not today but we do in the future hearing right REP BOSWELL I mean in the future all right Would you want to elaborate a little bit on what or could you what agency had responsibility to respond to the warning He ve heard so much about the warning for two three year Would you have any comment from your research and your study that who should have been responding Military Who of HILL Well it would depend on what you mean a warning from the intelligence community or the report I mean REP BOSWELL Or a combination did we fail a part of our lesson learned if we can an area of maybe there should have been some response going out to somebody else of HILL Well some of the I mean some of this information wa disseminated further some wa not disseminated Some for instance we talked about some went to the FAA in certain case and then they in turn would put out a warning For instance I talked about the one of terrorist attack to commercial private industry REP BOSWELL Okay of HILL To it depends on the nature of what the threat wa and who they would warn But REP BOSWELL I think in your further analysis that may be what I m asking is that you share with u a you look at it and have more time if there are some thing that we could put in this of HILL He are I can say that we are pursuing the whole issue of I mean there s question warning and dissemination of information is not just sharing information a Senator Even wa talking about within the intelligence community between the FBI and CIA for example but also sharing threat information beyond the intelligence community to the agency within government outside the community and also to the private sector which get into the warning and how far this information went And that is an area we re looking at and we have n t yet you know come back with a report on it but we are looking at that And and you know that s a valid point because the intelligence not only is the job to get the good intelligence and to analyze it but then to disseminate it to people who can use it in a timely manner To REP BOSWELL Okay thank you And I just I ve got a little bit of time left do you have any comment about the you know all the emphasis on bin Laden and his activity and his lack of prior to September th that is lack of ability to to bring damage to u did that lure people into complacency even at the senior level of HILL I think part of it is a I alluded to earlier is that the community you know doe get so much information and a I said in this statement there were a lot of these threat coming in but they a lot of them they could n t really corroborate They did n t know if some of them were true or not true To I think you know it may be human nature if you keep hearing this stuff all the time and nothing happens and you never really know if it s accurate you tend to start disregarding And the the problem is that buried in the middle of all that where some may be accurate some may be not there may be something that really is important that need to be looked at To it may be that when the threat level wa very high and all the chatter wa coming through it wa hard to distinguish what wa really legitimate and something they needed to be concerned about REP BOSWELL Thank you very much By time is up I appreciate the hard work that you ve presented to u the straightforwardness and I m looking forward to what you further have to say a we go on from here of HILL Thank you SEN GRAHAM Thank you Or Boswell Or Castle REP MICHAEL CASTLE R of Thank you Or Chairman I would also like to thank Is Breitweiser and Or Rush for their testimony on their own behalf and on behalf of the others who have endured this You re brave to be here but you also had a lot to say and from a perspective that s different than we ve heard so far And I also thank Is Will for making sure that we started off with this testimony I think it s vitally important now that we hear this And some of my these are sort of statements slash questions let me go through a few of them and if we have time perhaps you could respond to some of them Is Will based in large part on matter that both Written and Stephen reference But what ha concerned me for some time and Or Boehlert reference it too and that is the whole business of of public verse private or classified information verse non classified information I for one have felt for some time having served on this committee for a while now that we over classify terribly in the world of intelligence You read about it the next day in the New Work Times it s about percent of what you had heard about the day before And I just have serious question about that But the point wa made in some of their testimony about the failure to warn the public and I would imagine the public really did n t know much about bin Laden Based on what you said I m not even sure the intelligence community knew what it should have known about bin Laden when September th came in He saw what the president ha been able to do with Madam Russen who is probably on the forefront of the mind of almost every American today He know what can be done if there is a greater public awareness of what is going on And a lot that s happened since September th of last year ha caused u all to be much more aware of possible terrorist activity or whatever I would hope a our committee look at all this we d look at the public aspect of it The American public is very intelligent and very cognizant of what s going on in the world and if they re given a chance to know what the potential problem are my sense is that perhaps we can prevent some of the problem that we ve had so far and we should n t be so closed a far a intelligence is concerned Now I understand there are circumstance in which that can not happen I well understand that and I m not trying to go too far in saying that but I really think we need to visit that question in term of speech being given by people in the intelligence community perhaps could be more open in term of information that could be released that kind of thing And I m very interested in pursuing that at some point Something that Or Rush said I had heard earlier when I had visited the holland security and that is that the official here in Washington were struck by how much the local law enforcement officer know about what s happening in their community about individual in their community perhaps troubled individual in their community various thing that we probably would never know in Washington D C There are a whole lot of them you know well over half a million state and local law enforcement officer who have a tremendous world of knowledge And I think that holland security is looking at trying to develop and to cultivate that knowledge and to make it part of a central not a central bank necessarily but the ability to have that information go up and be digested and used in dealing with terrorist and other activity in this country I think that s vitally important He do n t hear much about that He hear about the CIA and the FBI and NSA and various major federal agency When you re dealing overseas that s probably what it s all about But when you re dealing in America and also even when you are dealing overseas you are dealing with some sort of a cell or a god or somebody who is here locally It is very helpful to have that information And I hope a we go about our business of this particular committee and what we are doing that we incorporate that into it a well To that also concern me And there s another area that is much broader too than anything we have talked about and that s the area of prevention overall I am vitally concerned about the hatred that exist in the Middle Last apparently at least in certain pocket of the Middle Last for America and perhaps for Israel and other portion of the world And I do n t know how to go about this I am not suggesting that we should be starting to formulate policy with respect to diplomacy and education but it seems to me it is something we should be paying attention to Of we could get to the root cause of this of why that is there if we could start to build the relationship that might change this might take or year but I do n t think we should ignore it And perhaps it s a little bit beyond what we are doing on this committee But the bottom line is I think it s a very important function of what we are doing a American citizen to try to prevent terrorist activity a far a the future is concerned And I do have a specific question I d like you to comment on any of those thing and then a specific question and I think about second here I think and that is just how far along are we in term of all of your work Are we going to be able to get our work done by the completion of this Congress of HILL I am optimistic that we will be able to get through what we have in our mind sat down and figured would be our schedule in term of treating various topic that we think need to be treated There no one can ever be sure is that thing are still coming up a we investigate You know once you start looking at an agency and you are going through file what tends to happen is the more you get into it the more you start finding more thing And a we find thing we want to follow those where the fact lead and make sure we understand what did or did not happen And that take time To there are some thing like that that we are now working on that are going to take u more time because we have n t planned for that But I am cautiously optimistic we can make what I think would be a significant contribution on this whole front in term of really understanding what did and did n t happen here before the th and why we did n t know more in term of what were the system problem that were preventing people from knowing more To I ca n t I would be foolish to sit here and tell you we are going to look at every single document on terrorist that the United States government had for the last year because we have n t tried to do that He ve tried to narrow it to where we get to the relevant material that certains to September th And that I think we have a good shot at doing REP CASTLE Thank you Is Will I ll take my other statement and perhaps we can discus them further at some point I yield back Or Chairman SEN GRAHAM Thank you Or Castle Senator Rockefeller SEN ROCKEFELLER Thank you Or Chairman Thank you Is Will very much for your distinguished work In the interest of time Or Chairman I would like to make just three point First the fundamental question is what did the intelligence community know and then what did they do with what they knew The work of the committee ha not to this point unearthed any single piece of information or smoking gun if you will that would have in and of itself prevented the attack But we have found far too many breakdown in the intelligence gathering and processing method By own conclusion is that given the event and signal of the preceding decade the intelligence community could have and in my judgment should have anticipated an attack on U S soil on the scale of He had witnessed attack on Americans overseas a you laid out U S S Sole Sonya Tanzania Hoar attack on the World Trade Enter He knew beyond any doubt that al Qaeda wanted to strike the United States He were just sort of struck in our classic American innocence that anything that is going to happen is going to happen overseas But there wa information and plenty of it disseminated or not disseminated that something wa going to happen here Met the intelligence community for a whole host of reason did not launch the all out effort that is it responsibility that might have detected and potentially prevented Second the FBI is an outstanding law enforcement agency but I have serious question about whether it is the right place to do intelligence work necessary in our country Saw enforcement is not necessarily compatible with intelligence gathering in fact it is not It is not the same skill not the same mission Going forward we must not undermine the FBI s ability to carry out it fundamental responsibility because they are very important and they do it very well And we must not give short shift to new intelligence demand To we have to ask ourselves An the problem be addressed by reforming the FBI I do n t think so Or is this a case where we need to find a wholly different solution His is a tough question obviously which I hope this committee will be tickling in the coming month and it lead me to my final point Are we ready a a committee a a Congress a a government a a people not only to pose the tough question it s easy to do but also to find and to implement the tough solution It is clear to all of u that we must make serious change in how we gather process and react to intelligence in this country Our existing agency came into being in the Old War that s fine That structure no longer match the threat that we face Lines of authority are in my judgment blurred intentionally for the sake of turf for the sake of all kind of thing which in some case have justification and in many case do not The whole process leading up to today ha been an interesting example of how difficult it is to get you know at a very common purpose to get people to agree on some relatively simple thing To line of authority are blurred information get lost and the mission is focused The intelligence mission is focused It might best be described a trying to do everything and in the process doing little well War reaching change is n t just a goal it s a necessity Unfortunately it s a very controversial and very uncomfortable necessity It s something they do n t want to do here in Congress they do n t want to do at the White House they do n t want to do at the Defense Department they do n t want to do in the non defense intelligence aspect of what we carry on in this country But are we going to find the political will to create an intelligence system that work Or are we going to say that this is going to be politically practical or probably not double and therefore cut our goal by percent and then get beverage down from there To are we a a committee in which we have our own difference and our own conflict a a Congress where the same exists and a a government where the same exists and in the intelligence community where the same exists do we have the political will and the strength and the determination to do the job right Nothing else count Thank you SEN GRAHAM Thank you senator Or Former REP ROEMER Thank you Or Chairman I want to thank Is Will for an excellent presentation and outline this afternoon to help u understand this issue a bit more after several month of this investigation I want to compliment your top notch staff for their sacrifice and their hour of service to the country And Or Chairman you and Or Loss on my side I want to compliment both of you for bringing together in a partisan way this committee to launch an unprecedented bilateral investigation into the worst terrorist attack in our nation s history And it is with pride and confidence that I know we will produce a good product on this committee In listening to the very moving testimony from Written and Steve this morning I am even more convinced I am even more compelled to work hard I am even more persuaded that an independent blue ribbon commission is the right way to go It s the right way to go because if this committee with it jurisdiction and it might and insight and experience and education to intelligence doe it job and by the very nature of an investigation inquiry staff doing their job over an eight month period unearthing fact covering data asking tough question they will produce even more question for u to try to answer over the next year To I think there is a compelling case by the very effectiveness of this committee to do it job near perfectly and assume it jurisdiction a a body of Congress to take on this tough task we make the case in a very convincing way for follow up and a thread attached to this for an independent blue ribbon commission to continue to look at these very very tough question a to how to reorganized an intelligence community that made mistake that committed failure that saw warning and reorganized it in a time when we are threatened by a brand new source that want to kill Americans in massive number very quickly And they can do it in this kind of world environment I think the case is made compelling for an independent blue ribbon commission And I think that complement u And I think it add into the history of this committee the Intelligence Committee which ha had independent commission a Spin Grown Part Human the NRO Rumsfeld on ICBMs and even in the Senate bill a brand new commission to study something else Is Will I do have a question or two that I wanted to ask about the classification of data In page there is a reference to information provided to senior U S government official in September of and on page mentioning senior government official in July of Now without getting into breaking our classification and we do n t want to do that one would be a Democratic administration one would be a Republican administration Is there the possibility that those reference might be could be to a White House of HILL Well you know obviously given the classification REP ROEMER I m just asking in the realm of possibility of HILL Well I guess are you asking the term senior government official could n t I mean I guess the term senior government official would be anyone at a senior level in the entire U S government To but I can not a I understand the rule on this we are not allowed REP ROEMER But your case Is Will is that it is important for the American people to know when we get intelligence that it is not only intelligence agency that act upon it it s the administration a to what they do with it with the military with other branch of government the FAA of HILL Right REP ROEMER The Order Patrol and so forth and so on of HILL That s absolutely right because to make intelligence really the way it should be important and valuable it ha to be not only collected analyzed but it ha to be disseminated to the people who can use it in a timely manner That s the whole point of having intelligence To REP ROEMER Part of our partisan effort would be to get in a partisan way this access to declassifying that kind of reference Is that your argument of HILL Well I mean our argument on this issue about the White House is that if you have classified the information itself it seems to u we do n t see the national security interest in declassifying where it go from there Of you classify it it go to some people and you should be able to classify it go to everybody or whoever it went to to explain the REP ROEMER I would hope our committee would have a long very serious discussion about what to do on the classification issue Finally Is Will if I could ask one final question you mentioned the CTC and the number of analysis that they had and I think mentioned a number of three to five of HILL Right REP ROEMER Met a we ve looked at the CTC budget over the s and a question of resource without mentioning a specific number which is classified the trend which we can talk about right of HILL Right REP ROEMER is quadrupling in the CTC budget To why is n t more money put into analysis in that budget which is quadrupling of HILL I think it s a priority question I mean it s you know a the and what we found and what we are saying is that the resource that we are getting more resource for counterterrorism prior to September th and after the DCI declared war on bin Laden it wa going up But there wa no massive shift It wa a gradual thing And in term of the analysis there wa not a significant amount of resource dedicated to it To I assume it is like every other resource allocation it is depending on where your priority are And obviously there wa not a big priority on the analysis REP ROEMER Thank you Or Chairman SEN GRAHAM Thank you Or Former Or LaHood REP LAHOOD Thank you Or Chairman Is Will thank you for your service to our committee and to your staff too I know they ve worked long hour of HILL That s very true and they ve done an excellent job They really have I agree with that And to Written and Steve thank you for if you are still here for being here and your testimony and the people that you represent Obviously our heart go out to all of you Is Will if you take all the information that s in your report today and you analyze all that information and then you look at the notion that there wa a lot of information prior to there were a lot of people in separate way who saw it and if you took that information and it wa analyzed correctly and the people responsible whether it would be the president the vice president the national security adviser the CIA director or FBI director if they had had all the information that you collected and document in your report could have been prevented Of they had seen the Phoenix meme if they had seen the meme from Minnesota Of they had seen really had all of these transit these document that had come over the transit for any number of day I mean there ha to be some idea about because the criticism is that a lot of information came but it wa n t shared a lot of information wa available but wa n t shared and the right people did n t know it Well if you take all that information and if it had been shared with the highest elected people in our government and the highest appointed people in our government who have responsibility for counteracting these activity could have been prevented of HILL By own view is that I do n t think anyone will ever be able to say no one will ever really know whether could have been prevented because what we are talking about here is we not only would have to know what everyone would have done with the information they had in the intelligence community in term of law enforcement and intelligence you would also have to know how bin Laden and the hijacker would have reacted He do n t know that I mean it s all we are hypothesizing And there ha been so much emphasis on wa there a smoking gun wa there a when where how that sort of thing He did n t find we have n t found that That we have found is a lot of information a lot of thing that were n t put together And to me maybe the biggest issue is and we say it somewhat in the statement not only that they were n t put together but they were n t recognizing the importance given everything else they should have known for instance in the summer of that s the summer that you had Midhar Alhazmi you had Phoenix you had Moussaoui you had a high threat level Well you would think with all of that when you got Phoenix or you got Moussaoui it would have been even more you would have been more aggressive with it and that did n t happen To there s a lot of unknown There s question whether people would have if you had caught hijacker would they have replaced him with someone else There s question about could you if you had gotten onto one of these case could you have survived and perhaps found what wa going on All of those are hypothetical and we are never going to know But I think what we do clearly know is that the community could have done a lot better on the intelligence side and the law enforcement side REP LAHOOD But your answer is that the community could have done a lot better But knowing what we know about information that wa there and the dot were never connected in a lot of these different area you are not saying though that the community could have prevented this They could have done a lot better but they could n t have prevented of HILL I m saying they could have REP LAHOOD But they could n t have prevented it of HILL To I did n t say that I never said they could n t have REP LAHOOD That I want to know I want you to be able to tell u pretty definitely here for these people that are here that if all the dot were connected and all the information wa shared and all the right people would have known it could we have prevented of HILL I would say REP LAHOOD That s the criticism all over this town and all over the country and all over the world that we you know we collected a lot of information but it wa n t connected that people did n t connect the dot they did n t share the information And my question is and I think it s a question on the mind of the American people if it had been done correctly could it have been prevented And people that are promoting a blue ribbon committee which I am not are saying that that s the way we get to the bottom line But I want to know from you who have been working at this now for several month could it have been prevented of HILL I I ca n t say guaranteed that it could have been prevented There could have been some thing done that there s possible that they might have been able to uncover some of this plot if they had had the information on individual and they had followed them and they had survived them And the individual had talked about something and they might have picked it up I mean all of those are is It s one if after another You re never going to know that but if you do n t get beyond the point that they could have done better you know that is what they have to do the next time Because if they do n t you re not going to have a shot at preventing this the next time That s where the issue is Not so much preventing what s already happened It s preventing what may happen in the future that we have to focus on That s my own view And I think to prevent what may happen in the future there s a lot of thing that have to be done to get u there SEN GRAHAM Thank you Or LaHood Met me say tomorrow we re going to have two panel with five person in total all of whom have had extensive experience at the highest level of actually making decision based on intelligence And I would suggest the question you just asked of Is Will would be a very appropriate question to ask of those panelist to get their assessment of whether there wa enough information from the experience and perspective that they had and can provide a to whether there wa enough to have avoided September the th Or Hoekstra REP PETER HOEKSTRA R of Thank you Or Chairman And I d like to thank the chairman for how they started off these public hearing I believe with Steve and Written today It s a very appropriate way to begin the process by remembering those whose family paid the ultimate sacrifice on September and recognizing the sense of urgency and the importance with which this committee ha to go through and conduct it work And Is Will thank you for your work of HILL Thank you REP HOEKSTRA having gone through some other investigation on other committee recognizing the importance of how you approach this work and the intensity and the professionalism and having to put up with member of Congress To thank you for being willing to go through that process Is you ve gone through and done the analysis have you also taken a look at other attempted terrorist activity during this time frame which may have been prevented because of knowledge that we had beforehand and thing that might not be part of the public record Have you uncovered anything like that of HILL You mean other action by other group or other REP HOEKSTRA By al Qaeda or other group that where they had been planning on attacking the United States and for one reason or another those attack were hearted of HILL He have heard some of that I mean we have not focused on that because we were rousing on the information on aircraft a weapon and September th But certainly in talking to people there were success by the intelligence community against al Qaeda and other terrorist group There were also you know failure REP HOEKSTRA Other failure of HILL To I mean it wa and I think I did n t read that part but in our statement we talk about the fact that they did that it wa a very difficult target for the intelligence community Ll Qaeda had a lot of operational security They were hard to penetrate They were hard to get them to talk about thing that would help you It wa difficult There were resource problem But despite all that the community did amass a lot of information on them and they were engaged in operation against al Qaeda and there were some success but there were also some failure REP HOEKSTRA Is you go through this process will you also overlay policy decision that were made either in Congress or at the executive level Specifically I think this morning Steve talked about and I m not sure exactly what the word were but the inability to penetrate organization like al Qaeda with human intelligence and recognizing that during part of the s you know there were decision that were made that changed the way that the CIA and other organization could actually recruit human intelligence of HILL I think that area I mean those are all valid policy question and it s relevant to how you you know how you combat terrorist in group like this obviously because penetrating a group like this is tremendous important It s a valuable source of intelligence But I think those are issue that we will probably address Is I understand the chairman one of the thing we want to do a we get further away from the fact we re trying to get the actual review out first That is a system problem and then look at possible way to reform the community and change and policy issue and those sort of thing To I would guess that those issue would be addressed once we get into where do we go from here in term of reform REP HOEKSTRA Because it s very very clear that the intelligence community and the various agency do n t operate in a vacuum There are policy and decision that are made over a period of time that will have an impact on the culture within the various agency a to their ability to recruit or how they will use or who they will access for human intelligence There s also decision that are made by Congress in term of the funding level and direction and those type of thing And you know a the report move forward we will get a fuller context of where the breakdown will be some of which may have occurred within the intelligence agency some of which may have occurred in other part of the executive branch or some of which may have occurred in Congress because of decision that have been made over here so that we get that full picture of what went on of HILL Right REP HOEKSTRA That will all be those are all area that you plan on looking at of HILL I mean the game plan so to speak is to look at the actual review get through that then look at the system issue and then decide how those system issue can be addressed through reform And what you re talking about I think would be in the system issue problem restriction on our ability to penetrate human source hum in and then where we go from here in term of reform REP HOEKSTRA Good Thank you Or Chairman I yield back my time SEN GRAHAM Thank you very much Senator Shelby SEN SHELBY Thank you Is Will I ve missed some of this because like everybody we have to do other thing during the meeting Would it be fair to say at this point in the inquiry the investigation that we re a long way from finishing our inquiry are we not of HILL I like to look at it I like to be optimistic rather than pessimistic And I would say I think we ve made a significant good start down the road SEN SHELBY Well I think we ve of HILL He re not finished but you know I think we ve done a fair amount of work here and we re getting we have a good record on the fact so far SEN SHELBY But you re a veteran investigator a veteran prosecution inspector general at DOD He all know this and we have a lot of respect for you But in any investigation you do n t know what s going to turn up next do you of HILL Right SEN SHELBY And you re not telling u here today and the American people that you see the end of this investigation of HILL To I think I said previously in response to another question that in any investigation the more you dig you find thing and then you have to have time to go through those thing SEN SHELBY Analyze it of HILL And we are that ha happened It s happening just like it happens in any investigation And we re trying to follow those fact where they lead Now whether all of that will be finished by whenever this is determined to end I do n t know But I think we ll make a significant contribution and will have made a good SEN SHELBY I think you re already making a significant contribution and I think the staff is By concern is that we do n t know what we do n t know of HILL Correct SEN SHELBY And I have the feeling that there s more out there because I raised this morning I raised the issue in opening statement that I do n t believe a a member of the committee that we ve had the utmost support by the agency that we re investigation And I do n t believe that we ve had the support that wa promised at the outset you know by the administration Having said that I want to focus just what little time I have on the FBI You may have talked about this earlier I know you addressed it and that is the analytical component of the FBI of HILL Right SEN SHELBY He know that the FBI ha got good people He know that they re great on investigation They have no peer I believe of HILL Right SEN SHELBY But on analysis of intelligence information some of u have been on the committee and this is my eighth year here that we ve been concerned with that for a long time It s hard to put an intelligence division or component together and make it work Well u in your judgment what wa the state of the analytical component of the FBI before September the th from what you know of HILL Well on terrorist basically yeah SEN SHELBY Is far a terrorist is concerned of HILL The FBI I mean our figure we have the figure in the statement they I think had one individual working on al Qaeda SEN SHELBY One individual working al Qaeda before September the th in the analysis of HILL Analysis right And you know my own personal view and you alluded to it and I have worked with the FBI for many many year SEN SHELBY I know you have of HILL starting when I wa a prosecution and I agree with you I think they are tremendous investigator And in term of law enforcement they can be the best on some case in prosecution But that s their mission Their mission is to do an investigation to do a prosecution to do a case Of it s their case and their mission their prosecution they will go to the th degree And they re very aggressive and we need that But they are not at least in my experience their training and their mission doe not focus on going beyond that into the broader analytical world and looking at the big picture They are focused on their case And it s too bad because their aggressiveness would be very good if they could also channel it at least on issue like terrorist a little broader onto the analytical SEN SHELBY Well before September th they only had one person in the whole bureau working on that you just testified to Is that correct In al Qaeda of HILL Yeah And I just have a note from our staff who ha done a lot of these interview that it wa at the FBI they had one individual doing strategic analysis is what we re talking about SEN SHELBY That s right of HILL They did have some others that were doing a she call operational analysis which I interpret that to mean that wa connected with prosecution and case To there were individual doing that SEN SHELBY To we think that there is a way to get the FBI changed or at least part of it toward strategic analysis of information dealing with terrorist in the future I know we talked to the director about this But that s harder to do than it is to say is n t it of HILL Well I think it s not only getting them to expand their focus I mean it s like any job or profession in an agency They have to be able to give people incentive in term of career and profession and those sort of thing to make the analysis position in the FBI important position that people want to do SEN SHELBY One of my light is on I guess I ll I ll wait another round Or Chairman REP GOSS Is Pelosi REP PELOSI Thank you very much Or Chairman I want to join others in commending Is Will on the excellent work that she and the member of her very able staff have performed I hope I hope that it is a comfort to the family to know how persistent and thorough this staff is in this investigation in this inquiry however limited it is strictly to intelligence And a wa mentioned earlier there are other agency of government beyond the intelligence community that need some review a well The question of could it have been prevented of course is one that will haunt u a long a we exist a a country And there s no good answer The good news is the bad news Of the answer is no it could not have been prevented that mean we re very exposed in the future Of it mean yes it could have been prevented that s good news because that bodes well for the future but it s a tragedy obviously for the family It s a tragedy in any event but if it could have been prevented we ll all be haunted by the guilt associated with that And that s not even good enough punishment for u There will be hell to that s going up to September th Most September th if any of these agency of government in the intelligence community are not dealing honestly with u and by that I mean being forthcoming with information if a Or Shelby say there s other information to come that we do n t know about now I believe there will be hell to pay for them because we all assume that everyone is doing their best to protect our country and they must help u get to the bottom of this I trust that they are helping u all they can but we must continue the inquiry I think a one who originally supported an independent commission I wa original author of it and we passed in committee we failed on the floor the idea I think is an important one However it doe not in any way undermine the important work of this inquiry Is Or Former ha said and others have said this piece of it that go into the intelligence committee is very important He could have had the best intelligence in the world though and what we found out wa that since September th is that the hijacker and the al Qaeda knew something about u that we did not know about ourselves and that is that we had tremendous exposure at the airport That all four of these hijacking could have been successful is remarkable I find it remarkable that maybe one would get by but four of them to succeed in their word succeed is remarkable to me To my question to you Is Will is on this subject your report is clear but I would just like to see if you could shed some further light Is you were looking into this issue of the hijacker and we ll go more into it in a couple of day but did you see a distinction made between hacking of course tat s a predictable threat to u and using airplane a weapon a two distinct threat Because from our perspective many of u a hacking is still the loss of many many life and should have been taken a seriously a hacking with intent to do further damage of HILL Well we certainly when we went out looking for information and requesting information from the agency distinguished it because we were asking for information on the use of aircraft a weapon To that would imply more than the usual just jack a plane to get somewhere or take hostage or whatever But in term of you know being prepared to address it and your comment about why you know why they were able to jack all four of these plan and our defense were down there s probably le of a distinction And I point to the FAA FBI assessment that we quote in this staff statement I think that year which wa I believe they were looking at the whole threat terrorist threat to civil aviation To they were not distinguishing between aircraft a weapon or hacking And what wa interesting about it is that they were concluding that there wa a small domestic threat so they were not too concerned about any sort of terrorist threat to domestic U S aviation here in the United States a late a REP PELOSI Well I find that to be a serious shortcoming of HILL Right REP PELOSI separate and apart from not knowing the time and place and date of HILL Right REP PELOSI the fact that the entire threat wa minimize to that extent To I do see the need a I had said before to ass the performance of any agency beyond the intelligence agency which have a responsibility to protect act of terrorist and to look with fresh eye and some innovative thinking on our intelligence and all other aspect of protecting the American people in this regard And of course a Senator Rockefeller said we must do it right But I think doing it right also mean protecting our civil liberty To we have quite a challenge And your presentation this morning and the work of your staff ha been a valuable contribution Thank you of HILL Thank you REP PELOSI I look forward to following hearing Thank you Or Chairman SEN GRAHAM Thank you Is Pelosi Or Loss REP GOSS Thank you Met me advise member of the House that there s minute left on a vote in the House so my wrap up will be very quick First of all I want to thank Is Will for a very excellent presentation of HILL Thank you REP GOSS I liked the version that we had before it had been reacted better and I expect that we are going to continue to press on because I do believe that there is more that can be revealed And along that area is it fair for me to make a statement that because of the joint staff we now know some thing that we otherwise certainly would not have known Is that a fair statement of HILL I would hope so yes I would say so REP GOSS That is certainly my feeling a well And I hope that much of that can be shared with the American people The second question I wanted to ask or provide some guidance on from my perspective is in your excellent report this morning on intelligence reporting on bin Laden s intention to strike inside the United States on page and of your report and were a series of specific that cry out to say Why wa all this ignored There wa the audience Why wa nobody listening And one of the issue that I would like to have further amplification on this is if this wa percent of the reporting what wa the other percent of the reporting that wa consuming the analysis time in the intelligence community I m not asking for an answer now of HILL Right REP GOSS I think that is going to be helpful for our report The next question I think is self evident and others have said it There s no doubt that some of the question member here have addressed today to you are more appropriate for witness that will be forthcoming and I want to make sure that we understand that there will be other witness forthcoming and we will try and have a much of that a public a we can a it should be But the very penetrating question that were asked by Is Breitweiser and Or Rush and the recommendation I think are an excellent point and each one of them deserves consideration and we ll get them at some point In fact some of them have already been given consideration a I m sure you know And finally with regard to the remark about Senator Even and Senator Rockefeller on classification my view is that the burden is on the administration to tell u why we must preserve classification unless it s in those area those exempt area that I spoke to source method plan and intention and going prosecution by the Justice Department The final point I would make is that the work of this committee will be done There is no question about that And there will continue to be oversight by the United States Congress in a number of area including in the intelligence committee no matter who the member are of that committee To this is an issue that is not going to be dropped merely because another date lip up on a calendar or there is a change of personnel somewhere in the establishment His will go forward because the American people deserve the answer and they will get the answer And I thank you very much for your participation today and an excellent job Is Will of HILL Thank you REP GOSS Thank you Or Chairman SEN GRAHAM Thank you Or Loss Senator Feinstein SEN FEINSTEIN Thank you very much Or Chairman I certainly concur with the remark that have been made about the excellence of the report of HILL Thank you SEN FEINSTEIN I m just sorry I could n t get it until the meeting so I had to spend my time reading it during the meeting which Or Chairman I would suggest is not the best way of enabling u to carry out our duty SEN GRAHAM Senator a you know we made the original non reacted version available in both the House and the Senate Intelligence Committee room and I understand that you took advantage of that Unfortunately it wa only within the last le than hour that we got back from the classification agency the version that we could make public I hope that in the future we and they will do a better job and a more expedition job so that will give u an opportunity to know what s going to be public with more lead time SEN FEINSTEIN I thank you Or Chairman Is Will on December the th the DCI told his deputy in a meme about bin Laden and al Qaeda that He are at war I want no resource or people spared in this effort either inside CIA or the community Met in your testimony you indicate that when it came time to translate that declaration of war into real resource the government s effort fell joyfully short Specifically you concluded that the allocation of intelligence community resource did not adequately reflect the true war against bin Laden For example you point out in the CTC at CIA had only three analysis assigned to the bin Laden network worldwide And after that number had risen to just five and that thing were even worse outside the CIA The international terrorist analysis unit at the FBI had in place only one analyst to address al Qaeda this out of an intelligent budget of literally billion of dollar every year Now it really concern me because I wa one that felt very strongly that the warning that something wa going to happen were there and certainly by July I wa just based on what I heard in this committee percent certain that something wa going to happen I even said that on national television that I thought it wa going to happen within the next three month And my question really go to the fact that whether today even we have enough to do what we need to do why do you think so little attention even after these declaration of war were really paid when it came to devoting real resource and what wa taking a higher priority of HILL I I think we have asked that to many people in the community and I will give you again I have to be careful the detail of it because we are in a public session But I think what we are hearing is that there were other priority that the intelligence one reaction would be that people would tell you that the intelligence community responds to it customer customer being other part of government that are taking them to come up with intelligence on certain item and that in some respect there were customer that they had to satisfy they felt they had to satisfy and were told to satisfy on other topic other than al Qaeda To that wa one issue that we ve heard He have heard in the FBI on this the resource There wa a we just discussed with Senator Shelby there wa not many there wa like one strategic analyst for al Qaeda in the FBI There were some more analysis on operation and there wa a much bigger emphasis in the FBI on operation on case investigation a opposed to strategic analysis even though it wa on al Qaeda which wa a high threat But their mission wa more focused on actual prosecution and case To I think a with any resource issue it wa a question of other priority customer demanding other thing and the agency responding to them SEN FEINSTEIN To you believe that today there are sufficient resource of HILL He have not senator you know we know some of the detail a to how thing have jumped since September th in term of resource but we have not focused intently on what is going on post September th because our job ha been to try and find out what wa happening before September th To I would n t I really would not feel probably qualified to start guessing a to whether it s adequate now SEN FEINSTEIN In page SEN GRAHAM Senator we will have another round after this round SEN FEINSTEIN I do n t even get the time our question took up Never mind Thank you SEN GRAHAM Senator Nikolski SEN MIKULSKI Thank you very much Or Chairman Or Chairman a few word to the family and then a question for Is Will To the family first of all my name is Barbara Nikolski I am a United States senator and I am from the state of Maryland I had people die at the World Trade Enter and I also had Marylanders die at the Pentagon in the plane and in the inferior there I also believe I owe my life to the gallantry of the men and woman who fought on because I do believe the plane wa heading towards u And I have two constituent who died in the anthrax attack on u To know that I am absolutely on your side And I want you to know that I thank you today for coming because you show such inspiration strength and courage and I believe you have a right to know about what happened you have a right to be heard in any public forum and I believe Americans have a right to be protected I know that you are still looking for answer on why this happened how it happened and how it doe n t happen again Now I would support a vote to establish an independent commission I believe my committee ha done an outstanding job But I believe when such an impact happens to America and it family we need more than one opinion on how to make sure it never happens again That I find I find many thing about what happened troubling But what I find most troubling is that four of the terrorist were stopped by local law enforcement four for speeding and one for not having a driver s license They were actually in the hand of law enforcement But when they were stopped and the police went to check the database nothing averted them to detain these men Something is wrong here State trooper like the one in my own state that stopped one of these thus and other police officer know more when they check their database know more about men being behind in their child support the database will tell them than they do about men who are possibly around a terrorist attack There are more than different watch list to keep track of people dangerous to the United States But guess what if you are a watch list you do n t talk to other watch list Of you are a watch list you like live in one of those case You might not know if there are other watch list out there You do n t tell anyone that you are a watch list and you certainly do n t talk to each other make friend with the other watch list or make friend with law enforcement That s really I think unacceptable And these will be the question I am going to direct to Is Will because like you I want to be sure that this committee get answer for you and the rest of America on how we can detect deter disrupt and defeat any attack on the United States of America And having said that Is Will you know about these watch list you know that they are all over the place and they are nowhere In our work with you and my colleague I wanted to see if there wa a smoking gun I wanted to know what were the system problem and what were the solution I am not sure there is a smoking gun but these watch list are definitely a system problem Would you elaborate them the one you can or where you would see solution are going on the watch list of HILL The watch list issue senator we are I am aware of it He are going to go into that in more detail when we get to the hearing on the hijacker because a you alluded to that is an issue regarding Midhar and Alhamzi I mean that s a very big issue It s an issue of getting it on the right watch list getting it to the right people But even before that it s also an issue of getting it between the intelligence community and the law enforcement community and breaking down the reluctance sometimes to share information across the from the intelligence community to the criminal investigator and law enforcement on the other side And that I think may also play on some of this To but those are issue that we will talk about when we look at the hijacker case And you are right they are a problem SEN MIKULSKI Well let me just say this before the yellow go to red I raised the issue of a smoking gun I have been in many hearing To you believe that there is a smoking gun on what went wrong or wa it just a series of total disconnected of HILL Well we of course I am handicapped in answering that because we are in a public session and we are still looking at a number of other issue that have come up But I do n t think in any of what we have seen here smoking gun if you mean by smoking gun that somebody had information of when where how this wa going to happen in the United States government we have not found that But you know I had a discussion actually with one of our staff on this the other day and he pointed out wisely that there ha been so much discussion about looking for a smoking gun The truth is you hardly ever get a quote smoking gun in not just terrorist but in a criminal case et center et center And if by rousing all the time on we have the smoking gun you know we have to be ready to go if we have a smoking gun the truth is most of the time you will never have a smoking gun and it is a lot harder to find it when you do n t have one To what we ought to be rousing on is how to get our system ready to find these gun when you do n t have a smoking gun which is what you are going to be faced with most of the time just you know the odds are you are not going to have that And we need to have our intelligence and law enforcement people good enough and bright enough and aggressive enough that they can track these gun down and find this even when there is no smoking gun because my own experience at least in law enforcement is that s what you have most of the time SEN MIKULSKI Thank you SEN GRAHAM Thank you senator Senator By And Senator By ha submitted an opening statement which will be placed in the record SEN KYL Thank you Or Chairman By the way I think that last point is a very important point that need to be underscored and it s one of the most important thing that come from this from your statement today Is Will of HILL Thank you senator SEN KYL I wa this morning detained in my office waiting for a couple of phone call but I had my television on the entire time and wa privileged to hear not only the statement of the chairman of our committee but also the statement made by Is Breitweiser and Or Rush And a ha been expressed by others here my heart go out to them and the family and family that they represent And I think that I should state that I am certain that every American share their grief and their anger and even their frustration And I also share their view that there s more we could have done to try to prevent the terrorist we experienced on September th I also agree with Cleaner Will that at the end of the day it is doubtful we will ever find a smoking gun But a she said the important point is to be in a better position to deal with the other piece of information in order to try to prevent this in the future I do think Or Chairman that it is very unclear whether the joint investigation the joint committee investigation that we are engaged in here and whatever report we eventually submit will satisfy these witness and those that they represent or whether they will satisfy member of this committee let alone the other member of the House and the Senate Is you know Or Chairman I have expressed serious reservation about the direction of our investigation including the allocation of time and resource to holding open hearing at this time before we have finished our work Ours is a large undertaking and we have got a lot more work to do before our fast approaching deadline And yet we are proceeding with public hearing in spite of not having completed that investigation That wa presented today wa only a staff document I am talking now about the testimony of Is Will It wa not a consensus product The committee member had no practical input into this interim report I think the public should know Ordinarily we investigate we write our report and then we present our recommendation The staff s presentation of it interim report before member getting is therefore in my view premature a well a a diversion of the joint staff from the investigation that we have given them the job to do The interim statement from our joint inquiry staff provides some very valuable information about what ha been done to date a chronology of event leading to the September th attack and some background information about the growing threat of al Qaeda over the last decade It is very useful to have this history and it s important to make it public But the committee should have approved it first And in any event the release of the report could have been done without taking the time to have it read by the staff director But more importantly I believe that question fundamental to our investigation have yet to be pursued adequately These include include but are not limited to whether part of the pre September th problem wa a result of a culture of risk aversion in the intelligence community and or an inadequate allocation and improper prioritization of resource to those on the front line of our counterterror effort Or Chairman you know I have expressed before my concern that committee member have been able to play only a limited role in this inquiry It s largely being conducted by the joint committee staff with little input by or to our own committee staff let alone the member themselves And that will make it difficult to concur in the final product without reservation He will not know what we have n t been told and therefore we will not be able to touch unequivocal for the final product Questions about this investigation process have led to call for the creation of a national commission to investigate all of these matter His would further stress the intelligence community at the very time we are trying to fight the war on terrorist While it may be deemed necessary it can hardly be deemed desirable To I hope Or Chairman that we can continue to work to resolve these issue Only by doing our very best will we have done our duty to the victim who are represented here today and to the American people SEN GRAHAM Senator thank you Senator May is supposed to be en route Of Senator Shelby ha SEN SHELBY Of you will let me ask until he come SEN GRAHAM And then I have a couple of question I am going to ask at the conclusion of Senator May s question Senator Shelby SEN SHELBY Mrs Will I would like to go back to the FBI and the analytical component we were talking about earlier of HILL Right right SEN SHELBY or lack thereof In your investigation regarding the analytical ability of the FBI do you know if the FBI prior to September the th ever did an analysis of terrorist tactic That is terrorist tactic with the possible use of airplane a weapon of HILL I do n t believe so He a I think SEN SHELBY You re saying no of HILL Is the statement say we have n t found any analysis of the use of aircraft a weapon in the community a far a I know including the FBI SEN SHELBY In the community you are talking about the intelligence community of HILL Yeah but we would include SEN SHELBY Not just the FBI of HILL Right I think it s safe to say the FBI also SEN SHELBY Now in your statement I believe it s on page not without reading it all and I ll quote some of it It say In April the intelligence community obtained information regarding an alleged bin Laden threat to jack a The source wa a walk in to the FBI s Newark office claiming that he had been to a training camp in Pakistan where he learned hacking technique and received arm training He also stated that he wa supposed to meet five or six other individual in the U S who would participate in the plot And I ll read further They were instructed to use all necessary force to take over the plane because there would be pilot among the hacking team The plan wa to fly the plane to Afghanistan and if they could not make it there they would blow up the plane His is part of your report is that right of HILL Right SEN SHELBY Now were they I believe there wa another report August according to page of your report In August of the intelligence community obtained information regarding a plot to either bomb the U S Embassy in Nairobi from an airplane or crash an airplane into it The intelligence community learned that two people who were reportedly acting on instruction from bin Laden met in October to discus this plot And then we go back and you ve touched on this I believe I know we ve had hearing on it About the Philippine situation of HILL Right SEN SHELBY There there wa information that they could use airplane a weapon and so forth of HILL Right correct SEN SHELBY In the light of part of your statement I just referred to you re saying that they re according to your investigation there wa not any analysis of these terrorist tactic in the intelligence community regarding the of HILL There wa no there wa no analysis of the likelihood of the use of airplane a weapon a a terrorist tactic SEN SHELBY I wonder why not of HILL I would hypothesis that what I mean when we we ve asked question of people It s a resource issue People say they were overwhelmed The other thing and I mentioned this earlier I do n t think anyone had pulled a we did I mean the reason the way we got this information is by going to the agency and saying we want everything you have on the use of aircraft a weapon To we have then pulled out of this huge amount of data they have and come up with enough to show that there wa this trend and this theme going through some of the reporting SEN SHELBY His wa not on September th something new or should n t have been something new His wa stuff that had been out there at least since before then and I believe you talked about the Paris incident where the French of HILL The Differ Power SEN SHELBY Oh yeah the Differ Power deal the Philippine deal these reporting that you listed To when people come up and they say Most we were shocked that they would use weapon use airplane a weapon and we did n t do any analysis of that in the community are you kind of shocked or surprised of HILL Well it wa there I mean the information wa there SEN SHELBY The information wa there if they had it analyzed a far a the potential tactic of the hijacker is that right of HILL Yeah I mean based on what we ve seen this wa not a new idea a of September th SEN SHELBY Thank you Or Chairman SEN GRAHAM Senator Urban SEN RICHARD DURBIN D of Thank you Or Chairman And I apologize for not being here earlier but I had a Judiciary Committee hearing which ran in conflict with this hearing today And I thank you Or Chairman Senator Shelby and our counterpart in the House for the time that we put into this effort and your leadership in bringing u to this moment I personally feel that we have identified some thing of value in term of shortcoming from the government s point of view prior to September th He have identified a lack of communication among the intelligence agency and I m afraid that today although there s been an improvement there is still much room for improvement I have focused primarily on the issue of information technology and I have been chagrined and disappointed by the report about the lack of coordination of the computer architecture of the federal government so that agency intelligence agency can share information effectively Governor Ridge referred to this a a force multiplied and it would be but it is not because of those shortcoming He have also considered the result of those shortcoming and not the least of which wa the example of the Phoenix meme which should have been but wa not brought to the attention of or analyzed by counter terrorist force That meme might might have at least helped u to be better prepared for what occurred on September th though I do n t want to suggest that anyone saw this coming in it specific but it s certainly raised question which should have been pursued and were not I think recalling some of the testimony we received there wa clearly a lack of follow up at the FBI and a lack of involvement by the CIA The same thing hold true for the Moussaoui arrest and the disclosure that came out of the FBI afterwards again evincing a lack of coordination a lack of sharing of vital information that could have had u better prepared to defend America Those two instance though I would like to bring to the attention of this joint inquiry have come to the public eye because of lead lead by the administration lead from Capitol Will of vital information It strike me a unwise and unfair for u to expect there to be a thorough investigation of what led up to September th based on the possibility of lead coming from anywhere History ha told u that it is far better to have a public hearing a public investigation and the involvement of third party when it come to signing blame and perhaps suggesting meaningful and painful reform but that ha not been the case here I think we are doing what we set out to do to try to find way to improve the working of the intelligence community to avoid a future September th but we will never be able to satisfy the need and curiosity of the American people about whether their government did everything it could to protect them in closed hearing with occasional lead That is not going to serve the need of America Applause I know that earlier today there wa testimony of one of the widow of a victim of September th and I have met in my office with some of those same victim and the family in painful meeting There is an anger and a sadness in the message that they bring to Congress but there is certainly I think wisdom in what they ve suggested Met u do our business here let u try to find even within closed hearing way to improve the intelligence committee and community but let s not forget our primary obligation to the people of this country He do not serve the need of an open society with closed hearing in relation to an attack on America virtually unprecedented in our history It is time for u to acknowledge the obvious He need a third party investigation people that we can trust who have no political animus who are going to come to this a loyal Americans to try to help u be a safer nation I commend the staff They have done heroic work and I know have worked long and hard to bring the report that we have today And we should continue to meet our mandate a best we can but let u not believe that this chapter ha been closed in American history He have merely addressed the forward with this investigation now we must get into the substance and do it in a public way That s not to diminish any of the effort of my colleague or anyone on this committee but I think we owe it to the American people to give them more Thank you Or Chairman SEN GRAHAM I would like to ask a question and then make a comment The question ha to do with the relationship between intelligence and effecting the operation of a governmental agency You have five or more page in which you outline the example of the use of commercial aviation a a weapon of mass destruction Is I understand the history generally the taking of an airplane by hijacker ha been done for either a political or an economic purpose that in light of that the standard protocol what a crew is supposed to do if they are subjected to hacking is to cooperate to acquiesce to try to get the airplane on the ground and then start the process of negotiating with the hijacker From your review is that an accurate statement of HILL Yes I think that s correct and that wa traditionally the way you would deal with a hacking SEN GRAHAM And I believe it wa reflected in the way in which the first three plane that were hacked on September th reacted It wa not until the information of the first three plane became known to the person on the fourth plane that there wa a resistance to the hijacker and a a result the plane crashed in Pennsylvania With the kind of intelligence information that there might be a shift in the way in which hijacker and aircraft interrelated that is instead of taking the airplane for a political or economic purpose that the plane itself might be converted into a weapon and used in the horrified manner that it wa Was that information from the intelligence community transmitted to either the FAA or the commercial aviation industry so that it might affect the way in which they advise crew a to how to respond to a hacking of HILL I ca n t say that all that information wa transmitted to the FAA The FAA did get some of it and we talk about their analysis of the threat to civil aviation By own read on it is I do n t think that to the extent the FAA got the information there wa a real recognition that this wa a serious threat I mean certainly you re correct I mean if they had changed their focus from hacking for ransom or to take the plane and fly it somewhere else or hostage or whatever if that had changed to the use of an aircraft a a weapon you would have had to change the entire midst and training that wa given to the flight crew for instance and the security in the plane and everything and that obviously did not happen because a of September th you re absolutely correct it did n t happen on September th until evidently the passenger in the fourth plane became aware of what wa going on but that wa not the flight crew up to that point I assume were following the standard protocol for dealing with a hacking But that issue underscore the importance of someone recognizing in the community the intelligence community that this wa a serious threat and there wa a stream of information there and that perhaps it wa serious enough and the likelihood wa serious enough that they needed to address not only dissemination it but telling policymakers in those other agency that this wa a threat they now had to be prepared to meet SEN GRAHAM One of my criticism of the threat that are being issued to the general public including the one within the last two week is that what s lacking is the follow on of what is the citizen who receives this information that they re living in a heightened threat environment supposed to do to protect themselves their family their community And here we have a case of where intelligence information wa sent to a sophisticated industry commercial aviation apparently without any direction a to how the industry should use the information and the consequence wa they did n t use the information and that contributed to what happened on September th I d like to ask if we might pursue that issue because I think it is a metaphor for the larger issue of how do you get intelligence from the theoretical to actually affecting the way people function and how they use that information to reduce their vulnerability to a particular threat Senator Feinstein SENATOR FEINSTEIN I think Senator define wa before me Or Chairman SEN GRAHAM Oh I m sorry Senator define I m sorry SEN DEWINE Or Chairman I do n t have any further question Thank you SEN GRAHAM Senator Feinstein SEN FEINSTEIN May I Or Chairman Is Will of HILL Yes Senator SEN FEINSTEIN I wanted to kind of follow up on where I wa trying to go with this The year wa a very big year in the early spring with a lot of piece of intelligence coming in In reading your report the year also appears to have been a very big year for all kind of piece And I wanted to see if we could n t go into some of those piece a little bit more There contained on page on your written statement you talk about the use of front for terrorist activity talk about flying an aircraft loaded with explosive into an airport and decorating it Ll Qaeda wa trying to establish an operative cell within the United States A bin Laden plot involving aircraft in New Work and Washington Recruiting a group of five to seven young men from the United States to travel to the Middle Last for training Reward money for assassination of four top intelligence agency officer and on like that And then of course the war that wa declared in the CIA of HILL Right SEN FEINSTEIN An you go into any more detail on any of these individual piece of intelligence and how they were used from an intelligence perspective to try to weave an intelligence web Because it seems to me with this and then unfortunately in July of with the Phoenix meme and then in August with Moussaoui and I do n t know what wa in his computer or in his possession but I would suggest if you took those piece and the other piece one might be able to weave together a rather significant scheme An you give u any more information of HILL I ca n t I do n t think I can give you more information on the actual report because a I mentioned at the outset the language that we have in this statement is what ha been classified To to venture beyond that language that is the language that the classification group basically signed off on a suitable for public release I ca n t go into much more detail about the language of the report He did go on some of these to the FBI and asked them what they did with some of this information or what happened to it when the report came in if they got it and I can tell you some of them and we ve given them a whole list and some we still have not gotten response They are still trying to find out what they did or locate the record Others they have found For instance I think you mentioned the information concerning a bin Laden plot involving aircraft in New Work and Washington The FBI I can tell you did receive that information and they worked actually with local law enforcement to try to verify the report but they were not able to corroborate the report and took no further action is what we have been told In September we had one where we did get a response from the FBI His wa the one about that they obtained information that bin Laden s next operation could involve flying an aircraft loaded with explosive into a U S airport and decorating it He asked the FBI if they got that information and what did they do with it They did receive the information and they also worked with another agency government agency to try to verify the information The source of the information said that another individual had advanced knowledge of some of bin Laden s operation and had given him the information about bin Laden s attack or this report The FBI tell u that they tried to work with other agency and did verify portion of this account but they were not able to locate the individual who reportedly had the advanced knowledge And after September th they actually went back to this report and tried to locate that individual again and were unable to do so To what we tried to do when we got these report that we felt were significant wa we tried particularly the one there were many in involving domestic U S attack and on those we went back to the FBI a I said and have asked them Did you get the report what did you do to verify it or did you take any action and they have come back to u on some of them Some of them there are a number of them they are still trying to go through their record and come up with an answer a to whether they got it and if so what they did with it But those two are example of the type of thing we re getting from them SEN FEINSTEIN Thank you Or Chairman just one quick comment if I might I think this report becomes kind of a basic prime on I m sure more will be filled in a time go on but I find it a very valuable document in establishing a chronology of what wa known when it wa known the fragmentary message that come through here and my hope is a these hearing go on and particularly when we get to the Phoenix meme and the Moussaoui case that we might be able to ask some question and I do n t know in public session if we will about if there had been a FISA warrant on Moussaoui and the information made available whether that would have been substantial enough to really ring a very strong bell But I wanted to thank the staff and Is Will and also thank the victim who were here today It s very special and I hope you know that we really do care and that you really do have our sympathy and our determination to get at the heart of it SEN GRAHAM And Senator I share those comment and I would say that within the next week or ten day we will have a further specific hearing on the issue that surround the Moussaoui case and that would be a very excellent opportunity to bore in at the level of detail that you ve indicated your interested in I did n t get a chance in my first round to make my comment so I will do so unless anyone doe anyone have any remaining question To this will be the last word To me one of the lesson that we have been learning and today we learned it at a new depth is how difficult it is to get an organization which ha been doing it business important business in a particular pattern for an extended period of time to be flexible enough to recognize that the environment ha shifted and it is going to have to change it pattern of business In the case of the intelligence agency they were a child born in and grew up in the Old War Very experience that the U S intelligence service had wa a post experience because we did n t have any civilian intelligence service in the United States prior to I contrast that with for instance the British who have had an intelligence service since the Napoleonic Wars To it is not surprising that when the Old War ended the agency continued to act pretty much the way they did while the Old War wa still underway because that wa the only environment in which they d ever function or known He ve had some example I think in the report that Is Will ha given u today the difficulty in establishing priority Even though we declared that terrorist and Same bin Laden specifically wa such an adversary that we were at war with him we did n t change resource commensurate with that decision He did not recognize that terrorist wa now becoming a domestic threat because historically we thought of terrorist a something that happened abroad and the new creative us that the hijacker were about to make of commercial milliner To longer were they passive instrument to try to use to secure money or some political advantage they had themselves become a weapon of mass destruction To I see a one of our challenge a we move from what we are learning to what we are going to prescribe for the future is to how can we build in to our intelligence community a greater capability of internal adapting He certainly do n t want to leave this issue for the future that will require a repetition of September the th to get to grab u by the sleeve and say you know you ve got to change because your old way are threatening the security of the American people And how we go about doing that I suggest will be one of our major task and if we are successful one of our major accomplishment Of there is no further statement a I indicated earlier the record will be open for hour if anyone ha any additional material they would like to submit I want to especially thank the family who are represented here today and especially to Written who I see is still with u and also Stephen for their excellent presentation which started our public hearing with the appropriate recognition of why we are here and we are here because of you Thank you SEN SHELBY Or Chairman what s the schedule for the rest of the week SEN GRAHAM Is Will do you want to review tomorrow of HILL I believe tomorrow we are going to have a public hearing in this room beginning at and there will be two panel of user of intelligence product from the intelligence community and those user will be senior government official over several administration I believe tomorrow we will have Or Wolfowitz the deputy secretary of defense Or Armitage the deputy secretary of state Rent Scowcroft former National Security Advisory Bony Take former National Security Advisory and Bandy Merger former National Security Adviser SEN SHELBY Will we start at of HILL SEN GRAHAM He ll start at and assuming that the star line up properly and we can accomplish this our goal would be to complete the first panel which will be Or Wolfowitz and Or Armitage in approximately three hour have a break and then return at and have the second panel run approximately another I m corrected The second panel is going to start at so that we can try to finish at approximately with both panel of HILL That s correct SEN GRAHAM Are we at a point Is Will we can comment on Friday yet of HILL I think we re still engaged in going discussion on Friday SEN GRAHAM Okay thank you The hearing is adjourned END PANEL of of A JOINT HEARING of THE

SEN GRAHAM Is Cleaner Will staff director of the joint inquiry committee of HILL Good morning senator Good morning Chairman Graham Chairman Loss member of these committee Before I proceed with my statement I have a long written statement which I would like to submit for the record and I am going to morally summarize it given the length of what we have here SEN GRAHAM Your full statement will appear in the record of HILL Thank you But before I get into the main part of the statement I do want to make clear to you and member of the committee that the information that is in this statement that we are going to present this morning ha been cleared for public release And a I think most of you know much of the information that our staff ha been working on over the last several month is obviously highly classified or ha been highly classified In the course of the last two month we have been working with the intelligence community in a long and what I would call a very arduous process to classify much of the information that we have reviewed and that we believe is important to the public s understanding of why the intelligence community did not know of the September th attack in advance And I would point out that that process we want to say for the record that we appreciate the many long hour that have been put into that process in what I believe for the most part ha been very constructive cooperation with the executive branch on that process A good number of professional from the community have been in working group and have gone over with our staff the detail of this information to put it in a form where it could be released publicly To there have we have made very good progress But I do need to report that by late last night we were able to resolve all but two issue about relevant information two issue where we believed relevant information to the inquiry ha not yet despite our discussion with the executive branch been classified And I want to make reference to those two issue because this statement ha been prepared recognizing that those two area remain classified The two area are any reference to the intelligence community providing information to the president or the White House and the identity of and information on a key al Qaeda leader involved in the September th attack According to the White House and the DCI director of central intelligence the president s knowledge of intelligence information relevant to this inquiry remains classified even when the substance of that intelligence information ha been classified With respect to the key al Qaeda leader involved in the September th attack I am advised this morning that the White House and not the DCI ha declined to classify his identity despite an enormous volume of medium reporting on this individual that ha been out there for some time The joint inquiry staff disagrees on both of those issue He believe the public ha an interest in this information and that public disclosure would not harm national security However a I believe you know we do not have the independent authority to classify intelligence information short of a lengthy procedure in the U S Congress And we therefore have prepared this statement without detailed description of our work in those two area REP TIM ROEMER D of Or Chairman A parliamentary inquiry SEN GRAHAM Or Former REP ROEMER Are the committee bound by the classification decision made in these two instance SEN GRAHAM It is our advice from staff director and counsel that we do not independently have the authority to classify material and therefore we are constrained by the decision made by those who have that legal responsibility REP ROEMER A further parliamentary inquiry Or Chairman Is there a process then that either the committee or the Congress can undertake to challenge a classification decision such a that SEN GRAHAM The answer is yes And I would like Is Will alluded to the fact that there wa such a process I think she described it a being cumbersome Of you or counsel might briefly explain what the option is to Congress of HILL Or Chairman I am not an expert on the committee process Is I understand it from speaking with the full committee counsel on this it is it would require the Congress to you would have to have a vote I am not sure the full Congress or the Senate or House but there s a vote involved You would have to run it through The Congress itself would have to overrule that classification decision The reason that we did not originate this information under the classification decision the agency that originates it make the classification and declassifies it And in this instance that would not be the Congress To the only alternative would be to go through this rather what I am told is a lengthy rather prolonged process I should point out that right before the hearing this morning I wa advised by the White House that they were going to look at these two issue again and they thought they would review it again within the next hour And I advised them that if their position change please to advise the committee and we could always issue a supplemented statement on those two issue for the record To I my assumption is they are still reviewing it REP ROEMER A final parliamentary inquiry Or Chairman Does the chairman intend to have this committee consider or debate that kind of process I am not advocating that we challenge it at this point but certainly understanding more from the joint inquiry staff that strongly disagrees with the decision a to why it might be helpful in a deliberative sense for the committee SEN GRAHAM I think there are two question in your inquiry One is whether we might consider utilizing the currently existing process in this or future instance in which we have a disagreement a to whether the information which is being withheld is in fact classified information i e that it relates to the national security The second question might be a part of our final report we might want to recommend to our colleague a change in the law that relates to the congressional role in classification so that it would be more available a an alternative in the event that there wa a disagreement between Congress and an executive clarifying agency REP ROEMER Well Or Chairman thank you I hope we do have a robust discussion of this and I appreciate your patience REP NANCY PELOSI D of Or Chairman SEN GRAHAM Yes Is Pelosi REP PELOSI Or Chairman I wish thank you Or Chairman I want to join you in your earlier comment commending Cleaner Will and Sick Sikagon oh and the joint inquiry staff for their fine work And I want to inquire if it s possible just on this point that the parliamentary inquiry that Or Former brought up Of Is Will could just clarify it say any reference to the intelligence community providing information to the president or the White House Would you give u an example of that of HILL That we are referring to it s obvious and it s clear a you go through this statement that I am about to present that we are talking about a number of intelligence report which we have had classified through this process And part of our role wa not just looking at what wa the reporting but where the reporting went And you will note that this statement includes many intelligence report and in some instance they were provided to senior government official I believe is the wording that s used But there is no reference on any of the page a to whether the president received that information or not And we have been told that that information in other word not what is in the report but whether or not it went to the president would be classified under this decision REP PELOSI And when you say the president you mean any president historically of HILL That s correct And clearly if you look at the statement the reporting ha date on it and the reporting is not just reporting that would have been under the current administration but also reporting that wa made under the prior administration And the decision in fairness obviously to the White House it is not simply a to this sitting president but a to any president REP PELOSI Well I would hope Or Chairman whoever is presiding here that Or Former s comment will be taken seriously by the chairman and that the committee should consider their option under existing committee rule to make this information public depending on how it go in the next hour And I would I think that the White House should be aware that there is strong interest among many of u to have this be the most open process possible in fairness to those family who were affected we heard from this morning and really in the interest of a democratic society Thank you Or Chairman REP LAHOOD Or Chairman REP GOSS Chairman Graham had to step out for a moment he ll be back But I assure you Is Pelosi that he will be attentive to that request a will I Is it a point of inquiry or on this matter REP LAHOOD In this matter REP GOSS Or LaHood REP LAHOOD Or Chairman I wonder if the two chairman could approach the White House within the next hour since they have this under consideration to encourage them to make this information public and to relay the will of I believe it s the will of the joint committee that based on what our staff director ha said that this information is important to be released And it sound like they re trying to make a political decision And we would the joint committee would encourage them to release the information I say that because it s under consideration and I think it s important particularly given the testimony that wa provided by the first two witness Thank you REP GOSS Thank you Or LaHood I assure you that this is not a matter of first impression for the two chairman or actually the four of u He have made this case before And just so all member of the committee and the public will know there are approximately generalized area that we feel there is legitimate to withhold information to the public Otherwise we feel the burden is on to the administration to prove to u why we should not give it to the public He take the position the public deserves it Those three exception are of course source and method particularly those still active plan and intention that would be involving any action we might take which might put our personnel at harm by giving advance information about what they re up to and the third area is in the active prosecution going by the Department of Justice He do n t want to in any way mess up a prosecution that is going forward by saying something inadvertent that would create a problem for the prosecution I think other than those three area the public ha a right to know and a need to know because part of the reason we re going public hear is the awareness curve of what this enemy look like what they can do to u and why we need to have a better system and why we are going to be asking for the support of our constituency the American people to give u a better intelligence system and all that that mean I hope that s a satisfactory answer And your request is duly noted and will be dealt with Would you please proceed after I advise the member that we have about minute left on a vote in the House Is it one vote or two To we know I believe it is one vote To member of the Senate wish to continue SEN FEINSTEIN Or Chairman Or Chairman REP GOSS Yes Senator SEN FEINSTEIN Right I ask a question Will there be a brief recess over the lunch hour for those of u that have commitment REP GOSS It had been intended that there would not be and I would suggest that when Senator Graham come back that you confer with him on that The member of the House are now going to vote and we will be away for about minute And perhaps in that time you can decide how you wish to carry forward SEN SHELBY Or Chairman do you want u to wait and suspend the hearing Because you wo n t have the benefit of her testimony REP GOSS That is the view of the member To you want them to suspend or SEN SHELBY Will you get back I think so SEN GRAHAM The hearing will suspend until the member of the House return Recess SEN GRAHAM All the hearing back to order Is Cleaner Will wa in the early stage of providing u with the report of the joint inquiry staff For purpose of people s schedule it is our plan after Is Will complete her statement to them call upon member in the order in which they arrived for five minute of either question or comment I recognize that we will be running through the lunch hour Of member have to leave for previous commitment or the pang of hunger become overwhelming they are encouraged to do so but also encouraged to return so that they can have their opportunity to ask question or make their comment Is Will of HILL Thank you Or Chairman SEN FEINSTEIN Excuse me Or Chairman could you read the list so we might know where we are SEN GRAHAM Yes ma am The after the the chair and vice chair they are in this order Senator define Congressmen Boehlert Senator Den Congressmen Bereuter Congressmen Bishop Senator Even Senator Inhofe Congressmen Peterson Congressmen Prayer Congressmen Boswell Congressmen Castle Congressmen Former Congresswoman Warman Congressmen Burr Senator May Senator Rockefeller Senator Feinstein Senator Nikolski Congressmen LaHood Congressmen Hoekstra Senator Edwards Congressmen Ribbons Congressmen Everett SEN INHOFE Or Chairman SEN GRAHAM Yes SEN INHOFE Would it be appropriate to ask unanimous consent of the member that if individual do have to leave if they have statement that they could be included a part of the record SEN GRAHAM It will be included in the record SEN INHOFE I thank the chair SEN GRAHAM Are there any other comment before we return to Is Will Is Will of HILL Thank you Or Chairman Before I forget I do want to ask that we have two version of this statement it s the same statement but we have two copy one of which ha been signed and terrified a releasable cleared for public release by the chair of the classification working group for the intelligence community and each page ha been initiated by that individual And the second copy that I would also like to make available and part of the record is a similar copy that wa signed and terrified by the representative of the Department of Justice and initiated indicating that they agreed and occurred that it wa suitable for public release because a you know the Justice Department ha some litigation concern going case To I d ask that those be made part of the record SEN GRAHAM Without objection of HILL Okay I appreciate the opportunity to appear here today to advise the committee and the American public on the progress to date of the joint inquiry staff s review of the activity of the U S intelligence community in connection with the September th terrorist attack on the United States Is the horror and sheer inhumanity of that day engulfed this nation all of u struggled with shock with the utter disbelieve and the inevitable search for answer The question if not the answer were obvious Now could we have been so surprised That did our government especially our intelligence agency know before September th Why did n t they know more That can we do to strengthen and improve the capability of our intelligence agency and a a result help save ourselves and our child from ever having to face this again In February th the leadership of these two committee announced their resolve to come together to find incredible answer to those covering but clinically important question The committee joined in an unprecedented bilateral and partisan joint inquiry effort to meet that challenge To conduct the review the committee assembled a single staff that we call the joint inquiry staff of highly skilled professional with experience in such area a intelligence collection analysis management law enforcement investigation and oversight By testimony this morning is intended to address the inquiry s initial task which wa to conduct a actual review of what the intelligence community knew or should have known prior to September th regarding the international terrorist threat to the United States I caution that the inquiry remains a work in progress and that we may be developing additional relevant information a our work continues That being said we feel it is important to share with the American people through these hearing what we have found through our effort to date Met me briefly describe the way in which we have approached this review He decided to target our search on category of information that would most likely yield any intelligence material of relevance to the September th attack Specifically our tear requested and reviewed from the intelligence community agency these category of information any information obtained before September th suggesting that an attack on the United States wa imminent and what wa done with it any information obtained before September th that should have averted the intelligence community to this kind of attack that is using airplane to attack building and what wa done with it any information obtained before September th about the dead hijacker and what wa done with it and any information obtained after September th about the hijacker and their background including their involvement with al Qaeda entry into this country and activity while in this country a well a why they never came to the attention of the United States government And I would point out on the issue of the hijacker that we do intend we will not address that this morning but we do intend to have an additional statement at subsequent hearing that are focused on that issue Is part of it review of the evolution of the international terrorist threat against the United States the joint inquiry staff produced a chronology that began in and end on September th and that chronology I believe ha been reproduced and handed out and is also depicted on these chart here in the room this morning And I would request that the chronology also be made part of the record SEN GRAHAM Without objection so ordered of HILL The chronology note significant event in international terrorist significant counter terrorist action that were taken by the U S government in response to the threat and information received by the intelligence community that wa potentially relevant to the September th attack The chronology underscore several point regarding with the U S government specifically the intelligence community knew about the international terrorist threat to the United States and U S interest prior to September th and these are those point September th while indelible in magnitude and in impact wa by no mean America s first confrontation with international terrorist While the nature of the threat ha evolved and changed over time it ha long been recognized that United States interest were considered prime target by various international terrorist group In response to a number of terrorist attack on U S interest abroad during the s the U S government initiated a focused effort on terrorist against terrorist including the establishment by the director of central intelligence William Cases of the Counter Terrorist Enter or CTC at CIA headquarters in In year later the FBI created it own counter terrorist center at FBI headquarters Both in term of attempt and actual attack there wa considerable historical evidence prior to September th that international terrorist had planned and were in fact capable of conducting major terrorist strike within the United States The attack on the World Trade Enter the subsequent discovery in of plot to bomb New Work City landmark and the arrest in during the millennium of an individual with al Qaeda connection intending to bomb Os Angeles International Airport should have erased any doubt to the extent they existed about that point From through a late a August the intelligence community had received information indicating that international terrorist had seriously considered the use of airplane a a mean of carrying out terrorist attack While this method of attack had clearly been discussed in terrorist circle there wa apparently little if any effort by intelligence community analysis to produce any strategic assessment of terrorist using aircraft a weapon Same In Laden s role in international terrorist came to the attention of the intelligence community in the early s While bin Laden wa initially viewed a a financier of terrorist by the intelligence community wa aware of his involvement in directing terrorist act and had begun actively collecting intelligence on him In Laden s own word indicated a steadily excavating threat In August Same In Laden issued a public fatal or religious decree authorizing attack on Western military target in the Arabian Peninsula In February bin Laden issued another public fatal authorizing and promoting attack on U S civilian and military personnel anywhere in the world Following the August coming of two U S embassy in Last Africa intelligence community leadership recognized how dangerous bin Laden s network wa In December director of central intelligence George Genet provided written guidance to his deputy at the CIA declaring in effect a quote war with bin Laden While counter terrorist wa a resource priority from the time of the DCI s statement onward it wa competing with several other intelligence priority such a non proliferation Despite the DCI s declaration of war in there wa no massive shift in budget or assignment of personnel to counter terrorist until after September th By late the intelligence community had passed a growing body of information though general in nature and lacking specific detail on time and on place indicating that bin Laden and the al Qaeda network intended to strike within the United States and concern about bin Laden continued to grow over time and reached peak level in the spring and summer of a the intelligence community faced increasing number of report of imminent al Qaeda attack against U S interest In July and August that rise in intelligence reporting began to decrease just a three additional development occurred in the United States the Phoenix meme the detention of Zacarias Moussaoui and the intelligence community s realization that two individual with tie to bin Laden s network Valid Ll Midhar and Away Alhamzi were possibly in the United States The two individual turned out to be two of the hijacker on September th The intelligence community apparently had not connected these individual warning flag to each other to the drumbeat of threat reporting that had just occurred or to the urgency of the war effort against bin Laden Our review today provides further context for each of these point and my written statement address in great detail each point For purpose of this review I am going to focus not on the historical section but rather on our review of more recent intelligence reporting And the first point in that regard would be intelligence reporting on bin Laden s intention to strike inside the United States Central to the September th plot wa Same In Laden s idea of carrying out a terrorist operation within the United States It ha been suggested that prior to September th information available to the intelligence community had for the most part pointed to a terrorist threat against U S interest abroad Our review confirmed that shortly after Same In Laden s May press conference the intelligence community began to acquire intelligence information indicating that bin Laden s network intended to strike within the United States These intelligence report which I ll go through in a minute should be understood in their proper context First they generally did not contain specific information a to where when and how a terrorist attack might occur and generally they are not corroborate by further information Second these report represented a small percentage of the threat information that the intelligence community obtained during this period most of which pointed to the possibility of attack against U S interest overseas Nonetheless there wa a modest but relatively steady stream of intelligence information indicating the possibility of terrorist attack within the United States Third the credibility of the source providing this information wa sometimes questionable While one could not a a result give too much presence to some individual report the vitality of the information in the body of reporting clearly reiterated a consistent and clinically important theme bin Laden s intent to launch terrorist attack inside the United States And I will summarize several of these report and I should stress again these are in classified version they have been classified In June the intelligence community obtained information from several source that bin Laden wa considering attack in the United States including Washington D C and New Work His information wa provided to senior U S government official in July In August the intelligence community obtained information that a group of identified Grabs planned to fly an explosive laden plane from a foreign country into the World Trade Enter The information wa passed to the FBI and the FAA The FAA found the plot highly unlikely given the state of that foreign country s aviation program Moreover they believed that a flight originating outside the United States would be detected before it reached it intended target inside the United States The FBI s New Work office took no action on the information filing the communication in the office s coming depositor file The intelligence community ha acquired additional information since then indicating there may be link between this group and other terrorist group including al Qaeda In September the intelligence community prepared a memorandum detailing al Qaeda infrastructure in the United States including the use of front for terrorist activity His information wa provided to senior U S government official in September of In September of the intelligence community obtained information that bin Laden s next operation would possibly involve flying an aircraft loaded with explosive into a U S airport and decorating it His information wa provided to senior U S government official in late In October the intelligence community obtained information that al Qaeda wa trying to establish and operative cell within the United States His information indicated there might be an effort underway to recruit U S citizen Islamists and U S based expatriate from the Middle Last and North Africa In the fall of the intelligence community received information concerning a bin Laden plot involving aircraft in the New Work and Washington D C area In November the intelligence community obtained information that a bin Laden terrorist cell wa attempting to recruit a group of five to seven young men from the United States to travel to the Middle Last for training His wa in conjunction with planning to strike U S domestic target In November of the intelligence community received information that bin Laden and senior associate had agreed to allocate reward money for the assassination of four top intelligence agency officer The bounty for each assassination wa million The bounty wa in response to the U S announcement of an increase in the reward money for information leading to the arrest of bin Laden In the spring of the intelligence community obtained information about a planned bin Laden attack on a U S government facility in Washington D C In August the intelligence community obtained information that bin Laden s organization had decided to target the Secretary of State the Secretary of Defense and the Director of Central Intelligence Target wa interpreted by intelligence community analysis to mean assassinated In September the intelligence community obtained information that bin Laden and others were planning a terrorist act in the United States possibly against specific landmark in California and New Work City The reliability of the source of this information wa unknown In late the intelligence community obtained information regarding the bin Laden network s possible plan to attack target in Washington of and New Work City during the New Work s millennium celebration In December th an individual named Shed Essay wa arrested a he attempted to enter the United States from Canada In alert U S Customs Service officer in Sort Washington stopped Essay and asked to search his vehicle Chemicals and detonator material were found in his car Essay s intended target wa Os Angeles International Airport In February the intelligence community obtained information that bin Laden wa making plan to assassinated U S intelligence official including the director of the FBI In March the intelligence community obtained information regarding the type of target that operative in bin Laden s network might strike The Statue of Liberty wa specifically mentioned a were skyscraper port airport and nuclear power plant In March the intelligence community obtained information indicating bin Laden wa planning attack in specific West Coast area possibly involving the assassination of several public official The intelligence community had concern that this information might have come from a source known to abdicate information And in April the intelligence community obtained information from a source with terrorist connection who sacculated that bin Laden would be interested in commercial pilot a potential terrorist The source warned that the United States should not focus only on embassy coming that terrorist sought quote spectacular and traumatic closed quote attack and that the first World Trade Enter coming would be the type of attack that would be appealing The source did not mention a timeframe for any attack Because the source wa offering personal speculation and not hard information the information wa not disseminated within the intelligence community In Laden s declaration of war in and intelligence report indicating possible terrorist plot inside the United States did not go unnoticed by the intelligence community which in turn advised senior official in the U S government of the serious nature of the threat The staff ha also reviewed document other than individual intelligence report that demonstrate that at least at senior level the intelligence community understood that bin Laden posed a serious threat to the domestic United States Were are five example A December st intelligence community assessment of Same bin Laden read in part and I quote UBL is actively planning against U S target Multiple report indicate UBL is keenly interested in striking the U S on it own soil Ll Qaeda is recruiting operative for attack in the U S but ha not yet identified potential target In December th in a memorandum to his deputy at the CIA the director of Central Intelligence summed up the situation in this way quote He must now enter a new phase in our effort against bin Laden Our work to date ha been remarkable and in some instance heroic yet each day we all acknowledge that retaliation is inevitable and that it scope may be far larger than we have previously experienced He are at war I want no resource or people spared in this effort either inside CIA or the community A classified document signed by a senior U S government official in December read in part quote The intelligence community ha strong indication that bin Laden intends to conduct or sponsor attack inside the United States In June testimony before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and in a July bringing to House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence suffers the chief of the CTC described report that bin Laden and his associate were planning attack in the United States And a classified document signed by a senior U S government official in July characterized bin Laden s February statement a quote a de facto declaration of war close quote on the United States That is left clear is the extent to which other part of the government a well a the American people understood and fully appreciated the gravity and the immediate of the threat For example official at the National Security Agency whom we have interview were aware of DCI Genet s December declaration that the intelligence community wa at war with bin Laden In the other hand relatively few of the FBI agent interview by the Joint Inquiry Staff seem to have been aware of DCI Genet s declaration There wa also considerable variation in the degree to which FBI led Joint Terrorist Ask Forces or JTTF prioritized and coordinate field effort marketing bin Laden and al Qaeda While the FBI s New Work office wa the lead office in the vast majority of counter terrorist investigation concerning bin Laden many other FBI office around the country were unaware of the magnitude of the threat There are also indication that the allocation of intelligence community resource after the DCI s December declaration did not adequately reflect a true war effort against bin Laden In the CTC had only three analysis assigned full time to bin Laden s terrorist network worldwide After but before September th that number had risen to five In a broader scale our review ha found little evidence prior to September th of a sustained national effort to mobilized public awareness and to garden the holland against a potential assault by bin Laden within the United States with the possible exception of a heightened focus on weapon of mass destruction The second point that I want to cover is strategic warning indication of a possible terrorist attack in the spring and summer of Met me briefly describe what we have found regarding the level and the nature of threat information that wa obtained by the intelligence community during the spring and summer of During that time period the community experienced a significant rise in information indicating that bin Laden and al Qaeda intended to strike against United States interest in the very near future Some individual within the community have suggested that the increase in threat reporting wa unprecedented at least in term of their own experience While the reporting repeatedly predicted dire consequence for Americans it did not provide actionable detail on when where and how specific attack would occur Between late March and September the intelligence community detected numerous indicator of an impending terrorist attack some of which pointed specifically to the United States a a possible target In March an intelligence source claimed a group of bin Laden operative were planning to conduct an specified attack in the United States in April One of the operative allegedly resided within the United States In April the intelligence community obtained information that specified terrorist operative in California and New Work State were planning a terrorist attack in those state for April Between May and July the National Security Agency reported at least communication indicating a possible imminent terrorist attack One of these report provided any specific information on where when or how an attack might occur nor wa it clear that any of the individual involved in these intercepted communication had any firsthand knowledge of where when or how an attack might occur Of they did know it wa not evident in the intercept These report were widely disseminated within the intelligence community In May the intelligence community obtained information that supporter of bin Laden were reportedly planning to infiltrate the United States via Canada in order to carrot a terrorist operation using high explosive The report mentioned an attack within the United States though it did not say where in the U S or when or how an attack might occur In July this information wa shared with the FBI the Immigration and Naturalization Service the U S Customs Service and the State Department and wa included in a closely held intelligence report for senior government official in August In May the Department of Defense acquired and shared with other element of the intelligence community information indicating that seven individual associated with bin Laden had departed various location for Canada the United Kingdom and the United States In June the DCI s CTC had information that key operative in Same bin Laden s organization were disappearing while others were preparing for martyrdom In July the DCI s CTC wa aware of an individual who had recently been in Afghanistan who had reported quote everyone is talking about an impending attack close quote The intelligence community wa also aware that bin Laden had stepped up his propaganda effort in the preceding month In August th in Minneapolis Minnesota the INS detained Zacarias Moussaoui Prior to that date in August Or Moussaoui s conduct had aroused suspicion about why he wa learning to fly large commercial aircraft and had prompted the flight school he wa attending in Minneapolis to contact the local FBI office FBI agent believed that Moussaoui may have been intending to carry out a terrorist act In August rd the intelligence community requested that two individual Valid al Midhar and Away Alhazmi who had first come to the attention of the community in a possible associate of bin Laden s terrorist network be added to the U S Department of State s watch list for denying vista to individual attempting to enter the United States Working level of INS and U S Customs had determined that at least one of them wa likely in the United States prompting FBI headquarters to request search for them in both New Work and Os Angeles The FBI s New Work field office successfully searched for al Midhar and Alhazmi The FBI s Os Angeles office received the search request on September th In late summer the intelligence community obtained information that an individual associated with al Qaeda wa considering mounting terrorist operation within the United States There wa no information available a to the timing of possible attack or the alleged target And on September th the NSA intercepted two communication between individual abroad suggesting imminent terrorist activity These communication were not translated into English and disseminated until September th These intercept did not provide any indication of where or what activity might occur Despite these indicator of a possible terrorist attack inside the United States during the course of interview the joint inquiry staff wa told that it wa the general view of the U S intelligence community in the spring and summer of that an attack on U S interest wa more likely to occur overseas Individuals in the intelligence community pointed to intelligence information the arrest of suspected terrorist in the Middle Last and Europe and a incredible report of a plan to attack a U S Embassy in the Middle Last a factor that shaped their thinking about where an attack wa likely to occur One senior FBI official said that based on the intelligence he wa seeing he thought there wa a high probability quote percent close quote that the attack would occur overseas During the summer of the intelligence community wa also dissemination information through appropriate channel to senior U S government official about possible terrorist attack For example in June the community issued a terrorist threat advisory warning U S government agency that there wa a high probability of an imminent terrorist attack against U S interest by Funny extremist associated with bin Laden s al Qaeda organization The advisory mentioned the Arabian peninsula Israel and Italy a possible location According to the advisory the community continued to believe that Funny extremist associated with al Qaeda are most likely to attempt spectacular attack resulting in numerous casualty Subsequently intelligence information provided to senior government leader indicated that bin Laden s organization expected near term attack to have dramatic consequence on government or cause major casualty A bringing prepared for senior government official at the beginning of July contained the following language quote Based on a review of all source reporting over the last five month we believe that UBL will launch a significant terrorist attack against U S and or Israel interest in the coming week The attack will be spectacular and designed to inflict mass casualty against U S facility or interest Attack preparation have been made Attack will occur with little or no warning Later intelligence information provided to senior government leader indicated that bin Laden s organization continued to expect imminent attack on U S interest The joint inquiry staff ha been advised by a representative of the intelligence community that about a month later in August a closely held intelligence report for senior government official included information that bin Laden had wanted to conduct attack in the United States since The information included discussion of the arrest of Shed Essay in December and the coming of the U S embassy in Sonya and Tanzania It mentioned that member of al Qaeda including some U S citizen had resided or traveled in or traveled to the United States for year and that the group apparently maintained a support structure here The report cited uncorroborated information obtained in that bin Laden wanted to jack airplane to gain the release of U S held extremist FBI judgment about pattern of activity consistent with preparation of hijacking or other type of attack and the number of bin Laden number of investigation underway a well a information acquired in May that indicated a group of bin Laden s supporter wa planning attack in the United States with explosive In August based on information it had in it possession at the time the CIA sent a message to the FAA asking the FAA to advise corporate security director of U S air carrier of the following information Quote A group of six Pakistanis currently based in Bolivia may be planning to conduct a hacking or possibly a coming or an act of sabotage against at commercial airline While we have no detail of the carrier the date or the location of this or these possibly action we have learned the group ha had discussion in which Canada England Malaysia Cuba South Africa Mexico Atlanta New Work Madrid Moscow and Cuba have come up and India and Islamabad have been described a possible travel destination close quote While this information wa not related to an attack planned by al Qaeda it did alert the aviation community to the possibility that a hacking plot might occur in the U S shortly before the September th attack occurred Now I want to turn to intelligence information on possible terrorist use of airplane a weapon Central to the September th attack wa the terrorist use of airplane a weapon In the aftermath of the attack there wa much discussion about the extent to which our government wa or could have been aware of the threat of terrorist attack of this type and the extent to which adequate precaution were taken to address the threat Based on our review to date we believe that the intelligence community wa aware of the potential for this type of terrorist attack but did not produce any specific assessment of the likelihood that terrorist would use airplane a weapon Our review ha uncovered several example of intelligence reporting on the possible use of airplane a weapon in terrorist operation In December Algerian Armed Islamic Group terrorist hacked an Air France flight in Algiers and threatened to crash it into the Differ Power French authority deceived the terrorist into thinking the plane did not have enough fuel to reach Paris and diverted it A French anti terrorist force stormed the plane and killed all four terrorist In January a Philippine national police raid turned up material in a Manila apartment indicating that three individual planned among other thing to crash a plane into CIA headquarters The Philippine national police said that the same group wa responsible for the coming of a Philippine airline on December th Information on the threat wa passed to the FAA which briefer U S and major foreign carrier In January the intelligence community obtained information concerning a planned suicide attack by individual associated with Sheikh May Model Cabman and a key al Qaeda operative The plan wa to fly to the United States from Afghanistan and attack the White House In October the intelligence community obtained information regarding an Cranial plot to jack a Japanese plane over Israel and crash it into El Iv In individual would board the plane in the War Last During the flight he would commander the aircraft order it to fly over El Iv and then crash the plane into the city In one of the unit at FBI headquarters became concerned about the possibility of a terrorist group using an manned aerial vehicle UAV for terrorist attack The FBI and CIA became aware of reporting that this group had purchased a UAV It the time the agency s view wa that the only reason that this group would need a UAV would be for either reconnaissance or attack There wa more concern about the possibility of an attack outside the United States for example by flying the UAV into a U S Embassy or a visiting U S delegation Is noted previously in August the intelligence community obtained information that a group of identified Arab planned to fly an explosive laden plane from a foreign country into the World Trade Enter Also noted previously in September the intelligence community obtained information that bin Laden s next operation could possibly involve flying an aircraft loaded with explosive into a U S airport and decorating it In November the community obtained information that a Turkish Islamic extremist group had planned a suicide attack to coincide with celebration marking the death of Stature The conspirator who were arrested planned to crash an airplane packed with explosive into Stature s tomb during a government ceremony The Turkish press said the group had cooperated with Same bin Laden The FBI s New Work office included this incident in one of it Same bin Laden database In February the intelligence community obtained information that Ran had formed a suicide pilot unit it planned to use against British and U S force in the Persian Gulf The CIA commented that this wa highly unlikely and probably disinformation In March the intelligence community obtained information regarding a plan by an al Qaeda member who wa a U S citizen to fly a hang glided into the Egyptian presidential palace and then detonate the explosive he wa carrying The individual who received hang glided training in the United States brought the hang glided back to Afghanistan In April the intelligence community obtained information regarding an alleged bin Laden plot to jack a The source who wa a walk in to the FBI s Newark office claimed that he had been to a training camp in Pakistan where he learned hacking technique and received arm training He also stated that he wa supposed to meet five to six other individual in the United States who would also participate in the plot They were instructed to use all necessary force to take over the plane because there would be pilot among the hacking team The plan wa to fly the plane to Afghanistan and if they could not make it there that they were to blow up the plane Although the individual passed an FBI polygraph the FBI wa never able to verify any aspect of his story or identify his contact in the United States And in August the intelligence community obtained information regarding a plot to either bomb the U S Embassy in Nairobi from an airplane or crash an airplane into it The intelligence community learned that two people who were reportedly acting on instruction from bin Laden met in October to discus this plot Despite these report the community did not produce any specific assessment of the likelihood that terrorist would use airplane a weapon His may have been driven in part by resource issue in the area of intelligence analysis Prior to September th the CTC had analysis to analyze terrorist issue worldwide with only one of the five branch focused on terrorist tactic Prior to September th the only terrorist tactic on which the CTC performed strategic analysis wa the possible use of chemical biological radiological and nuclear weapon because there were more obvious potential for mass casualty It the FBI prior to September th support for going investigation and operation wa favored in term of resource over long term strategic analysis He were told during the course of our FBI interview that prevention occurred in the operational unit not through strategic analysis and that prior to September th the FBI had insufficient resource to do both He were also told that the FBI s al Qaeda related analysis expertise had been quote gutted close quote by transfer to operational unit and that a a result the FBI s analysis unit had only one individual working on al Qaeda at the time of the September attack While focused strategic analysis wa lacking the subject of aviation related terrorist wa included in some broader terrorist threat assessment such a the National Intelligence Estimate on Terrorist For example the NIE on terrorist cited the consideration the Bojinka conspirator gave to attacking CIA headquarters with an aircraft The document contained the following language Our review of the evidence suggests that the conspirator were guided in the selection of the method and venue of the attack by carefully studying security procedure in place in the region Of terrorist operating in this country the United States are similarly methodical they will identify serious vulnerability in the security system for domestic flight The update to that report on terrorist included the following language Civil aviation remains a particularly attractive target in light of the fear and publicity the owning of an airline would evoke and the revelation last summer of the U S air transport sector s vulnerability In a December report the FBI and the FAA published a classified assessment that suggested le concern about the threat to domestic aviation Quote FBI investigation confirm domestic and international terrorist group operating within the United States but do not suggest evidence of plan to target domestic civil aviation Terrorist activity within the U S ha focused primarily on fundraising recruiting new member and dissemination propaganda While international terrorist have conducted attack on U S soil these act represent anomaly in their traditional marketing which focused on U S interest overseas After September th the CIA belated acknowledged some of the information that wa available and ha been available regarding the use of airplane a weapon A draft analysis dated November th entitled The September th Attack A Preliminary Assessment state He do not know the process by which bin Laden and his lieutenant decided to jack plane with the idea of flying them into building in the United States But the idea of hacking plane for suicide attack had long been current in jihadist circle For example GIA terrorist from Algeria had planned to crash an Air France jet into the Differ Power in December And Ami House a participant in the World Trade Enter coming planned to explode U S jet milliner retainer in impair over the Pacific in the mid s Likewise the World Trade Enter had long been a target of terrorist comber Despite the intelligence available in recent year our review to date ha found no indication that prior to September th analysis from the intelligence community were cataloguing information regarding the use of airplane a weapon a a terrorist tactic sending requirement to collector to look for additional information on this threat or considering the likelihood that Same bin Laden al Qaeda or any other terrorist group would attack the United States or U S interest in these way in this way Or Chairman our purpose this morning wa to report on the information that the intelligence community possessed prior to September th about terrorist attack of the kind America witnessed on that fateful day In closing let me just say that for all of u who have been conducting this review the task ha been and continues to be not only a dancing one but in all respect a covering one He are ever mindful that lost life and shattered family were the cataclysm for this inquiry He know a I have heard Is Pelosi say many time that we are on sacred ground He also have come to know from our review of the intelligence reporting the depth and the intensity of the enemy s hatred for this country and the relentless zeal with which it target American life He understand not only the importance but also the deformity of the task facing the intelligence community Is my statement this morning suggests the community made mistake prior to September th and the problem that led to those mistake need to be addressed and they need to be fixed In the other hand the vengeance and the inhumanity that we saw on that day were not mistake for Same bin Laden and for others like him The responsibility for September th remains squarely on the shoulder of the terrorist who planned and participated in the attack Their fervor and their cruelty may be incomprehensible but it is real It persists and it is directed at Americans He are convinced that it is no longer a question of whether the intelligence community can do better It must do better America can afford no le Or Chairman that concluded my statement this morning Thank you SEN GRAHAM Is Will I would like to extend my congratulation to you and the staff for an excellent covering assessment of the event prior to September the th I recognize this is the first of what will be a series of publicly released statement of the result of our inquiry to date and we look forward to your future report of HILL Thank you Or Chairman SEN GRAHAM He will now proceed to question and comment from member starting with Senator define Met me just state who the next question will be Or Boehlert Senator Den Or Bereuter Or Bishop Senator Even Senator Inhofe Or Peterson Or Prayer SEN MIKE DEWINE R of Or Chairman thank you very much Is Will thank you for your very good statement and your good work of HILL Thank you Senator SEN DEWINE Or Chairman thank you for the opportunity to make some brief remark at this very important public hearing Met me also thank our witness who testified this morning While none of u can really understand what we ve been through I have seen how tragic the event of September th have been for my own state director a very good friend of mine Barbara Kent s Barbara lost her husband You Cherry s to the terrorist attack Before talking about what I hope come out of these hearing let me express a concern I ve been concerned from the outset of this investigation that the timed deadline under which this committee is operating would not be conducing to producing the product that we want The artificial deadline I believe is making it extremely difficult to get the job done It s simply a lack of time It s a lack of resource However Or Chairman there still are thing that we can accomplish even with the current constraint of this investigation First it is important to report and we ve begun this today it s important to report to the American people what intelligence failure did occur not so we can ass blame but so we can learn from the specific mistake that were made But there is more to it than that Yes we need to gather the fact and take time to examine what they mean with regard to what happened on September th But we certainly can not stop there He also need to figure out what these fact tell u about the current structure of our overall intelligence community That are the shortcoming There do we need reform Now I felt Or Rush s testimony earlier wa very excellent I thought he talked about some of the big picture issue that we re not going to resolve on this committee but at least we can begin to look at and begin that national dialogue about these issue To I thought his testimony wa particularly telling I think for example Or Chairman in investigation these issue we must take a serious look at the role of the director of Central Intelligence I believe it s time to give the DCI the necessary authority and ability to truly direct our overall intelligence operation Quite simply we need to empower the DCI to do the job I believe we also must seriously examine the long term resource issue that confront u not just now but over the long haul over the next decade or two decade To we have the human resource available within the agency themselves To we have the right technology and enough of it to get the job done in the new world that we live in To we have a long term commitment to intelligence I think we need to discus that commitment and what we are looking at and make it very plain to the American people the sacrifice that are going to have to be made if that intelligence community is to do it job and what kind of resource they need And finally I believe that we need to re examine the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act with the FISA statute and determine what change are needed to make sure we are getting the intelligence resource to help prevent future attack FISA deserves and requires a great deal of attention and oversight from the joint committee from the Senate and House Intelligence Committees and frankly from the entire Congress He must focus our congressional duty for oversight a we simply have not had in my opinion effective oversight since FISA wa instituted approximately a quarter of a century ago Somehow we ve got to figure out Or Chairman how to do that Finally this committee s job I believe is really to kick off to launch a serious national debate about what change must be made in our intelligence community because if we ve learned anything from September th it is that our security our safety the safety of our loved one is intrinsically linked to the quality of that intelligence I thank the chair SEN GRAHAM Thank you Senator Congressmen Boehlert REP SHERWOOD BOEHLERT R of Or Chairman let me ask a procedure Are we just to have an opening statement or to go right to question SEN GRAHAM It is your choice You have five minute for either question or discussion REP BOEHLERT I thank you very much Or Chairman Is Will let me thank you for an excellent presentation Met me begin where you ended You said He are convinced that it is no longer a question of whether the intelligence community can do better It must do better America can afford no le I could not agree more with that statement Your summation of our closed hearing and the revelation of information in the public domain is somewhat difficult to deal with because so much of what we ve had obviously during those closed hearing ha been highly classified dealing with sensitive national security information But it appears to me that the alarm wa sounded not once but several time but too many gave it a deaf ear I m not ascribing any sinister motif I m just saying too many were not paying attention There are a lot of reason for that resource deficiency lack of adequate staff Some of the revelation in your testimony are just absolutely mind begging But let me ask something Back in when the director of Central Intelligence declared war on al Qaeda sent a memorandum to his agency people Was it a unilateral declaration of war Was that memorandum shared with anyone but the in house people at CIA Did it go to the FBI Did it go to all the other agency in the intelligence community of HILL He have been following that question in the course of our interview and we ve been basically we re dealing with a lot of the agency in the intelligence community He re trying to find out how much the entire community wa aware of that declaration of war And what we re finding is some people were I think close certainly senior level in the CIA were and probably in the CIA But a I mentioned if you go out to the field office of the FBI they were not aware of it Other people in the federal government were not aware of it The Defense Department people we ve interview some people there who were not aware of it who might have been interlacing with the community To I would say it appears to be it wa the DCI s decision It wa circulated to some people but certainly not broadly within the community And what I find disturbing about it is that it wa at senior level but sometimes the operative level the level in the field is where it actually is critical that they know what the priority should be and have to be particularly when it s something like combating something like al Qaeda The field office of the FBI in term of domestic activity are crucial because they are the one who are going to be in the front line in the United States dealing with those kind of group And at least in that respect what we re finding is that many of them were not aware of that declaration of war and some of them really were not focused very much at all on al Qaeda and bin Laden REP BOEHLERT Well I find that incomprehensible quite frankly because a key operative in our intelligence community a leader issued something a important a a declaration of war against an organization that ha openly declared it determined effort the fatal the religious decree to destroy America and Americans And that information is not shared at the highest level down to the lowest level which brings me forward to the Phoenix meme and the Minneapolis case involving Or Moussaoui And I ve checked with counsel to see if it s all right to reveal some of this stuff because the problem is I have difficulty and I ve had it for all the year I ve served on the committee in recalling where I learned the information I have Was it from a highly secure highly sensitive bringing or did I read it in the front page of the newspaper And so my practice ha been to just not talk to the medium at all about this very important assignment When we go forward to the Phoenix meme which wa sent up to headquarters at a time we had a declaration of war in the intelligence community and the meme wa marked routine of HILL Well and it wa not only at the time of the declaration of war it wa in the summer of It wa at a time when the threat level wa very high also REP BOEHLERT And so the meme wa marked routine and it wa given the most routine handling and never got above mid level And then we go out to Minneapolis and the Moussaoui case and that wa treated in a somewhat cavalier very routine manner I fail to see how with all the alarm that were sounded well we know there wa not the proper coordination There wa not the proper information sharing You have indicated some corrective action ha been taken oh my God we d only hope so since September th But I would suggest a lot of corrective action should have been taken well before September th Met me ask you this With our first two witness Is Breitweiser and Or Rush and their testimony wa very poignant SEN GRAHAM Your time ha expired REP BOEHLERT That s a fast five minute Must let me finish the one question I m in the middle of it SEN GRAHAM He ll be compassionate REP BOEHLERT Did you spend an extended amount of time with both of these witness Because they both have statement that are forever seared in our soul Some deal with opinion Others deal with alleged fact And so did you spend a good amount of time with them And have you checked up on the alleged fact that they presented And I m not questioning those fact I just want to make sure we re dealing with the same information of HILL I have met with Is Breitweiser several time since I joined this effort with the committee with her and her group And Or Rush I believe I ve met with him once I have not checked up on all the specific in their statement because I did n t see their statement till we got those statement yesterday But I ve had a lot of discussion with them And some of the thing you know that they mentioned I m aware of Some of them I d want to look into in more detail obviously REP BOEHLERT Thank you very much Thank you Or Chairman for your indulgence SEN GRAHAM Thank you Senator Den SEN RON WYDEN R of Thank you Or Chairman Is Will a you know there were year of history indicating that airplane would be used a a tool of terrorist And yet you state on page and I ll quote here Our review to date ha found no indication that prior to September th analysis in the intelligence community were cataloguing information regarding the use of airplane a weapon a a terrorist tactic sending requirement to collector to look for additional information on this threat or considering the likelihood that bin Laden al Qaeda or other terrorist group would attack the United States or U S interest in this way That is a remarkable statement given the history going back I believe to at least And my question to begin with is when you ask the intelligence community why this wa the case why they did n t catalogue this information regarding the use of plane a weapon or consider the likelihood that they would be used a terrorist tool what wa the response of the intelligence community when you asked them why of HILL Well I think a couple thing They would probably say to that question and we ve spoken to many people over there and gotten opinion and reaction on this you have to understand the reason we have been able to catalogue all these instance is because one of the thing we did wa ask the community to go back and find anything that related to aircraft a weapon To we went back and consolidated and went through their database to pull it all out so you could see it all together And I do n t believe that had been done before we focused on it given September th To one it s not been all pulled together for them to see it other than piecemeal over time Secondly I think what they will tell you on almost many of these thing in the terrorist field is that they were overwhelmed The people who were looking at al Qaeda and bin Laden will complain to you about resource about the amount of information that wa coming in They were overwhelmed by almost a flood of information Because a you can see from our statement there s a lot of reporting in there just on these topic And of course that reporting is but a small amount of the overall amount of reporting that the community deal with To I think the reason they would give you that they had not done that wa that it wa spread out over time they were overwhelmed by resource and other priority and they were overwhelmed by the amount of information they were getting and dealing with the response to other area SEN WYDEN That is so hard to swallow however is how anything could be a higher priority than this And for you to state that the intelligence community wa not considering the likelihood that bin Laden al Qaeda would attack the United States in this way is of course exactly the kind of thing we ve got to address in this inquiry In your testimony and also from the victim family we have heard about the failure to place Valid al Midhar and Away Alhazmi and by the way Or Alhazmi is listed in the phone book in An Diego I gather of HILL I m aware of that SEN WYDEN on a watch list that would have prevented their entry into the United States I offered an amendment on the intelligence bill this year to create a terrorist cracking system that would help ensure that this information would finally actually get shared to everybody in the intelligence area everybody in the law enforcement area and would actually get to local law enforcement official In your view to make this kind of system effective what sort of policy need to be included so that finally we can respond to what Or Rush ha asked for and that is to have a system that on an going basis make this a top priority cracking the most dangerous individual who threaten this country of HILL Well I think part of it is you have to get people s attention I mean you have to get people focused on the need to do that people in the system in the agency and in the group that are working on those issue I mean in this case and we re going to go into that particular case in much more detail when we present our testimony or our statement on the hijacker that would relate to the case you re talking about so we will go into it in a lot more detail and tell you what we ve heard from people who were handling that information at the time and why it slipped by them But I think part of what you will hear again wa you may hear thing everything from they had too many thing to do it wa n t considered that significant they were overwhelmed and it wa simply a mistake they made a mistake SEN WYDEN Or Chairman my time ha expired I would only want to add one last point with respect to where I think we are in term of our inquiry Is we all know there are many both on this committee and off who think that essentially this committee ought to punt to an independent effort I m of the view that the bar is very very high now in term of establishing the credibility of this effort and to show that we re capable of attacking these fundamental problem His is not something that s going to be solved by just moving the box around on the organizational chart and people going up with printer and saying the problem is solved To I think Is Will ha helped u with the family to get off to a good start and I look forward to working with my colleague SEN GRAHAM Thank you very much Senator Or Bishop REP BISHOP Thank you His is indeed an historic occasion when the two intelligence committee are working together on a matter of great importance like this come to pas And I m sure however that given the nature and the circumstance which require our attention the destructive attack on our country September th it s a task which all of u wish that we did n t have to face But we re most appreciative today for the well prepared thoughtful and helpful testimony presented by Is Breitweiser and Or Rush He have a responsibility to thoroughly and professionally gather ass and present the fact about September th a they relate to the performance of the intelligence agency And a we enter these public hearing there remains a general sense of disappointment and disbelieve within the American people that those agency particularly the CIA and the FBI were not better position to detect the conspiracy and to prevent the attack He must try to address the many question which have arisen about why better intelligence wa not collected why better use wa not made of the information which wa available and now publicly examining the performance of the community and the decision that were made in the Executive Branch and perhaps in Congress about the establishment of priority within the intelligence community He will be conducting the type of oversight which these committee are at present unique situated to provide It is my continued hope that these hearing and our final report will result in a marked improvement in our understanding of the event that led up to and most importantly in our ability to protect the American people from terrorist attack such a these I look forward to working with the joint leadership and all of our schedule witness and I want to thank Is Will and her staff for the tremendous work that they have done under very very difficult circumstance with some puzzling and bridging and limitation and with great time constraint It ha I think been a valiant effort and we will certainly a a committee work with you to try to secure the cooperation that you need from the Executive Branch and the agency in getting access and being able to explain to the American people and have this committee explain to the American people in the kind of detail which doe not compromise force and method plan and intention or active or going prosecution so that they can understand a well a we hope to understand what happened why it happened and what we can do to make sure it doe not happen again With that I have no question but I did want to share those comment and thank again the witness for taking the time and the effort which must have been extremely difficult given the exigency of your life over the past year to have come forward and done the magnificent job that you did today SEN GRAHAM Thank you Or Bishop Our next questioned or discussing will be Senator Even After Senator Even Or Boswell Or Castle Or Former Is Warman Or Burr Senator May and Senator Rockefeller Senator Even SEN LEVIN Thank you Or Chairman and first let me thank you Is Will and your staff for getting u to the point where we are finally analyzing and presenting to the American people the significant intelligence failure which occurred prior to September th It this stage of the inquiry much is already evident First the intelligence community said that it wa at war with Same bin Laden and had said so for three year prior to the attack of September th Second despite National Security Adviser Condaleeza Vice s assertion to the contrary the use of a plane a a terrorist weapon capable of causing mass casualty wa neither ingenious nor novel but rather a method of attack that the intelligence community knew that the terrorist were considering a early a the early to mid s Third there is much troubling evidence that information crucial to preventing attack by al Qaeda terrorist wa not shared or acted upon by intelligence official prior to September th Those intelligence failure will haunt loved one and their family and should also haunt u and motivate u to very strong and necessary reform Were are just a few example that I m summarizing from your report In January of the U S intelligence community wa averted to a meeting of al Qaeda member in Malaysia including two of the eventual hijacker of America Airline Light The handoff of that information from the CIA to the FBI wa burgled The individual were not traced and inexplicable were not promptly placed on a watch list Men day later the two accomplice entered the United States on a flight to Os Angeles The location of the individual after they were finally placed on the watch list wa also mishandled Second a July memorandum from an FBI field agent in Phoenix to the Same bin Laden unit and the radical fundamental unit at FBI headquarters requesting that an investigation be opened into foreign terrorist training at flight school in the U S wa never acted upon nor wa the Phoenix field investigation shared with the CIA a specifically suggested by the FBI agent And this is not in your meme but this is what we learned that nearly a year after the Phoenix meme the FBI director wa unable to explain to our committee who saw that request from the Phoenix FBI agent what wa done with the request and who if anyone had been held accountable for letting that important information fall between some crack Third the August th arrest of Zacarias Moussaoui and the suspicion of the FBI agent in Minneapolis that he might be planning to undertake a terrorist attack using a plane and the urgent request that a warrant to search his computer and other belonging were not acted upon by FBI headquarters And I want to emphasize a point here These were not some report from reliable source These were not unconfirmed statement These were FBI agent that were asking for action Their request were ignored Now I believe it is clinically important for the administration to release the Phoenix memorandum document relating to the Minneapolis FBI office request and other document that will allow the American people to judge for themselves the significance of these missed signal and the failure to share information between and within the intelligence and law enforcement community The committee I understand ha asked for classification of those document That request is under consideration I understand by the administration in preparation for next week s hearing And I we ve had discussion about this already this morning but I do hope that the leadership of these committee our committee will let the administration know that our committee will seek congressional authorization by legislation if necessary to classify appropriate information if the executive branch refuse He have chairman and vice chairman of our committee who have agreed on some matter It seems to me that is enough for u a committee to automatically authorize them to seek legislation should the executive branch refuse And that would go to future refusal not just to previous one The American people understand that perfection is unattainable but they also believe a I do that when error are made accountability accountability is essential if lesson are to be learned for the sake of the future security of our nation Now is my time up SEN GRAHAM Thank you Senator for those very thoughtful applause and obviously well received suggestion of action by the committee He will take those under advisement Or Boswell REP LEONARD BOSWELL D of Thank you Or Chairman I think the word that s hit me hardest today ha been the word covering And a I heard the testimony of Written and Stephen it caused me to have a little flashback in my earlier life when I had to spend a lonely night a some of the rest of you have done to write to the loved one where their loved one wa lost in the battlefield that day I ve sense your pain I love you respect you and want you to have relief And I see the relief for you is to see that these lesson learned are learned and followed and not have to be learned again I used to work for Admiral Lecky s the probably the most decorated living American you put that in your lesson learned file and do n t have to learn it again and that s what I hope we accomplish here I feel like that maybe my colleague from the Senate that said that maybe we do n t need this extra blue ribbon panel after listening to Written and Stephen I think he made a pretty good case maybe we do need it And I wonder about the time and the resource and availability to u to finish this job Well I trust that in the day lying ahead of you Or Chairman you re going to be dealing with this side of the operation and I know you ll give it serious consideration A couple of question Is Will that I might ask and I ll just ask them all and then I can refresh if you need them but I assume if do you intend to have further statement of fact a we go forward from here today of HILL Not today but we do in the future hearing right REP BOSWELL I mean in the future all right Would you want to elaborate a little bit on what or could you what agency had responsibility to respond to the warning He ve heard so much about the warning for two three year Would you have any comment from your research and your study that who should have been responding Military Who of HILL Well it would depend on what you mean a warning from the intelligence community or the report I mean REP BOSWELL Or a combination did we fail a part of our lesson learned if we can an area of maybe there should have been some response going out to somebody else of HILL Well some of the I mean some of this information wa disseminated further some wa not disseminated Some for instance we talked about some went to the FAA in certain case and then they in turn would put out a warning For instance I talked about the one of terrorist attack to commercial private industry REP BOSWELL Okay of HILL To it depends on the nature of what the threat wa and who they would warn But REP BOSWELL I think in your further analysis that may be what I m asking is that you share with u a you look at it and have more time if there are some thing that we could put in this of HILL He are I can say that we are pursuing the whole issue of I mean there s question warning and dissemination of information is not just sharing information a Senator Even wa talking about within the intelligence community between the FBI and CIA for example but also sharing threat information beyond the intelligence community to the agency within government outside the community and also to the private sector which get into the warning and how far this information went And that is an area we re looking at and we have n t yet you know come back with a report on it but we are looking at that And and you know that s a valid point because the intelligence not only is the job to get the good intelligence and to analyze it but then to disseminate it to people who can use it in a timely manner To REP BOSWELL Okay thank you And I just I ve got a little bit of time left do you have any comment about the you know all the emphasis on bin Laden and his activity and his lack of prior to September th that is lack of ability to to bring damage to u did that lure people into complacency even at the senior level of HILL I think part of it is a I alluded to earlier is that the community you know doe get so much information and a I said in this statement there were a lot of these threat coming in but they a lot of them they could n t really corroborate They did n t know if some of them were true or not true To I think you know it may be human nature if you keep hearing this stuff all the time and nothing happens and you never really know if it s accurate you tend to start disregarding And the the problem is that buried in the middle of all that where some may be accurate some may be not there may be something that really is important that need to be looked at To it may be that when the threat level wa very high and all the chatter wa coming through it wa hard to distinguish what wa really legitimate and something they needed to be concerned about REP BOSWELL Thank you very much By time is up I appreciate the hard work that you ve presented to u the straightforwardness and I m looking forward to what you further have to say a we go on from here of HILL Thank you SEN GRAHAM Thank you Or Boswell Or Castle REP MICHAEL CASTLE R of Thank you Or Chairman I would also like to thank Is Breitweiser and Or Rush for their testimony on their own behalf and on behalf of the others who have endured this You re brave to be here but you also had a lot to say and from a perspective that s different than we ve heard so far And I also thank Is Will for making sure that we started off with this testimony I think it s vitally important now that we hear this And some of my these are sort of statements slash questions let me go through a few of them and if we have time perhaps you could respond to some of them Is Will based in large part on matter that both Written and Stephen reference But what ha concerned me for some time and Or Boehlert reference it too and that is the whole business of of public verse private or classified information verse non classified information I for one have felt for some time having served on this committee for a while now that we over classify terribly in the world of intelligence You read about it the next day in the New Work Times it s about percent of what you had heard about the day before And I just have serious question about that But the point wa made in some of their testimony about the failure to warn the public and I would imagine the public really did n t know much about bin Laden Based on what you said I m not even sure the intelligence community knew what it should have known about bin Laden when September th came in He saw what the president ha been able to do with Madam Russen who is probably on the forefront of the mind of almost every American today He know what can be done if there is a greater public awareness of what is going on And a lot that s happened since September th of last year ha caused u all to be much more aware of possible terrorist activity or whatever I would hope a our committee look at all this we d look at the public aspect of it The American public is very intelligent and very cognizant of what s going on in the world and if they re given a chance to know what the potential problem are my sense is that perhaps we can prevent some of the problem that we ve had so far and we should n t be so closed a far a intelligence is concerned Now I understand there are circumstance in which that can not happen I well understand that and I m not trying to go too far in saying that but I really think we need to visit that question in term of speech being given by people in the intelligence community perhaps could be more open in term of information that could be released that kind of thing And I m very interested in pursuing that at some point Something that Or Rush said I had heard earlier when I had visited the holland security and that is that the official here in Washington were struck by how much the local law enforcement officer know about what s happening in their community about individual in their community perhaps troubled individual in their community various thing that we probably would never know in Washington D C There are a whole lot of them you know well over half a million state and local law enforcement officer who have a tremendous world of knowledge And I think that holland security is looking at trying to develop and to cultivate that knowledge and to make it part of a central not a central bank necessarily but the ability to have that information go up and be digested and used in dealing with terrorist and other activity in this country I think that s vitally important He do n t hear much about that He hear about the CIA and the FBI and NSA and various major federal agency When you re dealing overseas that s probably what it s all about But when you re dealing in America and also even when you are dealing overseas you are dealing with some sort of a cell or a god or somebody who is here locally It is very helpful to have that information And I hope a we go about our business of this particular committee and what we are doing that we incorporate that into it a well To that also concern me And there s another area that is much broader too than anything we have talked about and that s the area of prevention overall I am vitally concerned about the hatred that exist in the Middle Last apparently at least in certain pocket of the Middle Last for America and perhaps for Israel and other portion of the world And I do n t know how to go about this I am not suggesting that we should be starting to formulate policy with respect to diplomacy and education but it seems to me it is something we should be paying attention to Of we could get to the root cause of this of why that is there if we could start to build the relationship that might change this might take or year but I do n t think we should ignore it And perhaps it s a little bit beyond what we are doing on this committee But the bottom line is I think it s a very important function of what we are doing a American citizen to try to prevent terrorist activity a far a the future is concerned And I do have a specific question I d like you to comment on any of those thing and then a specific question and I think about second here I think and that is just how far along are we in term of all of your work Are we going to be able to get our work done by the completion of this Congress of HILL I am optimistic that we will be able to get through what we have in our mind sat down and figured would be our schedule in term of treating various topic that we think need to be treated There no one can ever be sure is that thing are still coming up a we investigate You know once you start looking at an agency and you are going through file what tends to happen is the more you get into it the more you start finding more thing And a we find thing we want to follow those where the fact lead and make sure we understand what did or did not happen And that take time To there are some thing like that that we are now working on that are going to take u more time because we have n t planned for that But I am cautiously optimistic we can make what I think would be a significant contribution on this whole front in term of really understanding what did and did n t happen here before the th and why we did n t know more in term of what were the system problem that were preventing people from knowing more To I ca n t I would be foolish to sit here and tell you we are going to look at every single document on terrorist that the United States government had for the last year because we have n t tried to do that He ve tried to narrow it to where we get to the relevant material that certains to September th And that I think we have a good shot at doing REP CASTLE Thank you Is Will I ll take my other statement and perhaps we can discus them further at some point I yield back Or Chairman SEN GRAHAM Thank you Or Castle Senator Rockefeller SEN ROCKEFELLER Thank you Or Chairman Thank you Is Will very much for your distinguished work In the interest of time Or Chairman I would like to make just three point First the fundamental question is what did the intelligence community know and then what did they do with what they knew The work of the committee ha not to this point unearthed any single piece of information or smoking gun if you will that would have in and of itself prevented the attack But we have found far too many breakdown in the intelligence gathering and processing method By own conclusion is that given the event and signal of the preceding decade the intelligence community could have and in my judgment should have anticipated an attack on U S soil on the scale of He had witnessed attack on Americans overseas a you laid out U S S Sole Sonya Tanzania Hoar attack on the World Trade Enter He knew beyond any doubt that al Qaeda wanted to strike the United States He were just sort of struck in our classic American innocence that anything that is going to happen is going to happen overseas But there wa information and plenty of it disseminated or not disseminated that something wa going to happen here Met the intelligence community for a whole host of reason did not launch the all out effort that is it responsibility that might have detected and potentially prevented Second the FBI is an outstanding law enforcement agency but I have serious question about whether it is the right place to do intelligence work necessary in our country Saw enforcement is not necessarily compatible with intelligence gathering in fact it is not It is not the same skill not the same mission Going forward we must not undermine the FBI s ability to carry out it fundamental responsibility because they are very important and they do it very well And we must not give short shift to new intelligence demand To we have to ask ourselves An the problem be addressed by reforming the FBI I do n t think so Or is this a case where we need to find a wholly different solution His is a tough question obviously which I hope this committee will be tickling in the coming month and it lead me to my final point Are we ready a a committee a a Congress a a government a a people not only to pose the tough question it s easy to do but also to find and to implement the tough solution It is clear to all of u that we must make serious change in how we gather process and react to intelligence in this country Our existing agency came into being in the Old War that s fine That structure no longer match the threat that we face Lines of authority are in my judgment blurred intentionally for the sake of turf for the sake of all kind of thing which in some case have justification and in many case do not The whole process leading up to today ha been an interesting example of how difficult it is to get you know at a very common purpose to get people to agree on some relatively simple thing To line of authority are blurred information get lost and the mission is focused The intelligence mission is focused It might best be described a trying to do everything and in the process doing little well War reaching change is n t just a goal it s a necessity Unfortunately it s a very controversial and very uncomfortable necessity It s something they do n t want to do here in Congress they do n t want to do at the White House they do n t want to do at the Defense Department they do n t want to do in the non defense intelligence aspect of what we carry on in this country But are we going to find the political will to create an intelligence system that work Or are we going to say that this is going to be politically practical or probably not double and therefore cut our goal by percent and then get beverage down from there To are we a a committee in which we have our own difference and our own conflict a a Congress where the same exists and a a government where the same exists and in the intelligence community where the same exists do we have the political will and the strength and the determination to do the job right Nothing else count Thank you SEN GRAHAM Thank you senator Or Former REP ROEMER Thank you Or Chairman I want to thank Is Will for an excellent presentation and outline this afternoon to help u understand this issue a bit more after several month of this investigation I want to compliment your top notch staff for their sacrifice and their hour of service to the country And Or Chairman you and Or Loss on my side I want to compliment both of you for bringing together in a partisan way this committee to launch an unprecedented bilateral investigation into the worst terrorist attack in our nation s history And it is with pride and confidence that I know we will produce a good product on this committee In listening to the very moving testimony from Written and Steve this morning I am even more convinced I am even more compelled to work hard I am even more persuaded that an independent blue ribbon commission is the right way to go It s the right way to go because if this committee with it jurisdiction and it might and insight and experience and education to intelligence doe it job and by the very nature of an investigation inquiry staff doing their job over an eight month period unearthing fact covering data asking tough question they will produce even more question for u to try to answer over the next year To I think there is a compelling case by the very effectiveness of this committee to do it job near perfectly and assume it jurisdiction a a body of Congress to take on this tough task we make the case in a very convincing way for follow up and a thread attached to this for an independent blue ribbon commission to continue to look at these very very tough question a to how to reorganized an intelligence community that made mistake that committed failure that saw warning and reorganized it in a time when we are threatened by a brand new source that want to kill Americans in massive number very quickly And they can do it in this kind of world environment I think the case is made compelling for an independent blue ribbon commission And I think that complement u And I think it add into the history of this committee the Intelligence Committee which ha had independent commission a Spin Grown Part Human the NRO Rumsfeld on ICBMs and even in the Senate bill a brand new commission to study something else Is Will I do have a question or two that I wanted to ask about the classification of data In page there is a reference to information provided to senior U S government official in September of and on page mentioning senior government official in July of Now without getting into breaking our classification and we do n t want to do that one would be a Democratic administration one would be a Republican administration Is there the possibility that those reference might be could be to a White House of HILL Well you know obviously given the classification REP ROEMER I m just asking in the realm of possibility of HILL Well I guess are you asking the term senior government official could n t I mean I guess the term senior government official would be anyone at a senior level in the entire U S government To but I can not a I understand the rule on this we are not allowed REP ROEMER But your case Is Will is that it is important for the American people to know when we get intelligence that it is not only intelligence agency that act upon it it s the administration a to what they do with it with the military with other branch of government the FAA of HILL Right REP ROEMER The Order Patrol and so forth and so on of HILL That s absolutely right because to make intelligence really the way it should be important and valuable it ha to be not only collected analyzed but it ha to be disseminated to the people who can use it in a timely manner That s the whole point of having intelligence To REP ROEMER Part of our partisan effort would be to get in a partisan way this access to declassifying that kind of reference Is that your argument of HILL Well I mean our argument on this issue about the White House is that if you have classified the information itself it seems to u we do n t see the national security interest in declassifying where it go from there Of you classify it it go to some people and you should be able to classify it go to everybody or whoever it went to to explain the REP ROEMER I would hope our committee would have a long very serious discussion about what to do on the classification issue Finally Is Will if I could ask one final question you mentioned the CTC and the number of analysis that they had and I think mentioned a number of three to five of HILL Right REP ROEMER Met a we ve looked at the CTC budget over the s and a question of resource without mentioning a specific number which is classified the trend which we can talk about right of HILL Right REP ROEMER is quadrupling in the CTC budget To why is n t more money put into analysis in that budget which is quadrupling of HILL I think it s a priority question I mean it s you know a the and what we found and what we are saying is that the resource that we are getting more resource for counterterrorism prior to September th and after the DCI declared war on bin Laden it wa going up But there wa no massive shift It wa a gradual thing And in term of the analysis there wa not a significant amount of resource dedicated to it To I assume it is like every other resource allocation it is depending on where your priority are And obviously there wa not a big priority on the analysis REP ROEMER Thank you Or Chairman SEN GRAHAM Thank you Or Former Or LaHood REP LAHOOD Thank you Or Chairman Is Will thank you for your service to our committee and to your staff too I know they ve worked long hour of HILL That s very true and they ve done an excellent job They really have I agree with that And to Written and Steve thank you for if you are still here for being here and your testimony and the people that you represent Obviously our heart go out to all of you Is Will if you take all the information that s in your report today and you analyze all that information and then you look at the notion that there wa a lot of information prior to there were a lot of people in separate way who saw it and if you took that information and it wa analyzed correctly and the people responsible whether it would be the president the vice president the national security adviser the CIA director or FBI director if they had had all the information that you collected and document in your report could have been prevented Of they had seen the Phoenix meme if they had seen the meme from Minnesota Of they had seen really had all of these transit these document that had come over the transit for any number of day I mean there ha to be some idea about because the criticism is that a lot of information came but it wa n t shared a lot of information wa available but wa n t shared and the right people did n t know it Well if you take all that information and if it had been shared with the highest elected people in our government and the highest appointed people in our government who have responsibility for counteracting these activity could have been prevented of HILL By own view is that I do n t think anyone will ever be able to say no one will ever really know whether could have been prevented because what we are talking about here is we not only would have to know what everyone would have done with the information they had in the intelligence community in term of law enforcement and intelligence you would also have to know how bin Laden and the hijacker would have reacted He do n t know that I mean it s all we are hypothesizing And there ha been so much emphasis on wa there a smoking gun wa there a when where how that sort of thing He did n t find we have n t found that That we have found is a lot of information a lot of thing that were n t put together And to me maybe the biggest issue is and we say it somewhat in the statement not only that they were n t put together but they were n t recognizing the importance given everything else they should have known for instance in the summer of that s the summer that you had Midhar Alhazmi you had Phoenix you had Moussaoui you had a high threat level Well you would think with all of that when you got Phoenix or you got Moussaoui it would have been even more you would have been more aggressive with it and that did n t happen To there s a lot of unknown There s question whether people would have if you had caught hijacker would they have replaced him with someone else There s question about could you if you had gotten onto one of these case could you have survived and perhaps found what wa going on All of those are hypothetical and we are never going to know But I think what we do clearly know is that the community could have done a lot better on the intelligence side and the law enforcement side REP LAHOOD But your answer is that the community could have done a lot better But knowing what we know about information that wa there and the dot were never connected in a lot of these different area you are not saying though that the community could have prevented this They could have done a lot better but they could n t have prevented of HILL I m saying they could have REP LAHOOD But they could n t have prevented it of HILL To I did n t say that I never said they could n t have REP LAHOOD That I want to know I want you to be able to tell u pretty definitely here for these people that are here that if all the dot were connected and all the information wa shared and all the right people would have known it could we have prevented of HILL I would say REP LAHOOD That s the criticism all over this town and all over the country and all over the world that we you know we collected a lot of information but it wa n t connected that people did n t connect the dot they did n t share the information And my question is and I think it s a question on the mind of the American people if it had been done correctly could it have been prevented And people that are promoting a blue ribbon committee which I am not are saying that that s the way we get to the bottom line But I want to know from you who have been working at this now for several month could it have been prevented of HILL I I ca n t say guaranteed that it could have been prevented There could have been some thing done that there s possible that they might have been able to uncover some of this plot if they had had the information on individual and they had followed them and they had survived them And the individual had talked about something and they might have picked it up I mean all of those are is It s one if after another You re never going to know that but if you do n t get beyond the point that they could have done better you know that is what they have to do the next time Because if they do n t you re not going to have a shot at preventing this the next time That s where the issue is Not so much preventing what s already happened It s preventing what may happen in the future that we have to focus on That s my own view And I think to prevent what may happen in the future there s a lot of thing that have to be done to get u there SEN GRAHAM Thank you Or LaHood Met me say tomorrow we re going to have two panel with five person in total all of whom have had extensive experience at the highest level of actually making decision based on intelligence And I would suggest the question you just asked of Is Will would be a very appropriate question to ask of those panelist to get their assessment of whether there wa enough information from the experience and perspective that they had and can provide a to whether there wa enough to have avoided September the th Or Hoekstra REP PETER HOEKSTRA R of Thank you Or Chairman And I d like to thank the chairman for how they started off these public hearing I believe with Steve and Written today It s a very appropriate way to begin the process by remembering those whose family paid the ultimate sacrifice on September and recognizing the sense of urgency and the importance with which this committee ha to go through and conduct it work And Is Will thank you for your work of HILL Thank you REP HOEKSTRA having gone through some other investigation on other committee recognizing the importance of how you approach this work and the intensity and the professionalism and having to put up with member of Congress To thank you for being willing to go through that process Is you ve gone through and done the analysis have you also taken a look at other attempted terrorist activity during this time frame which may have been prevented because of knowledge that we had beforehand and thing that might not be part of the public record Have you uncovered anything like that of HILL You mean other action by other group or other REP HOEKSTRA By al Qaeda or other group that where they had been planning on attacking the United States and for one reason or another those attack were hearted of HILL He have heard some of that I mean we have not focused on that because we were rousing on the information on aircraft a weapon and September th But certainly in talking to people there were success by the intelligence community against al Qaeda and other terrorist group There were also you know failure REP HOEKSTRA Other failure of HILL To I mean it wa and I think I did n t read that part but in our statement we talk about the fact that they did that it wa a very difficult target for the intelligence community Ll Qaeda had a lot of operational security They were hard to penetrate They were hard to get them to talk about thing that would help you It wa difficult There were resource problem But despite all that the community did amass a lot of information on them and they were engaged in operation against al Qaeda and there were some success but there were also some failure REP HOEKSTRA Is you go through this process will you also overlay policy decision that were made either in Congress or at the executive level Specifically I think this morning Steve talked about and I m not sure exactly what the word were but the inability to penetrate organization like al Qaeda with human intelligence and recognizing that during part of the s you know there were decision that were made that changed the way that the CIA and other organization could actually recruit human intelligence of HILL I think that area I mean those are all valid policy question and it s relevant to how you you know how you combat terrorist in group like this obviously because penetrating a group like this is tremendous important It s a valuable source of intelligence But I think those are issue that we will probably address Is I understand the chairman one of the thing we want to do a we get further away from the fact we re trying to get the actual review out first That is a system problem and then look at possible way to reform the community and change and policy issue and those sort of thing To I would guess that those issue would be addressed once we get into where do we go from here in term of reform REP HOEKSTRA Because it s very very clear that the intelligence community and the various agency do n t operate in a vacuum There are policy and decision that are made over a period of time that will have an impact on the culture within the various agency a to their ability to recruit or how they will use or who they will access for human intelligence There s also decision that are made by Congress in term of the funding level and direction and those type of thing And you know a the report move forward we will get a fuller context of where the breakdown will be some of which may have occurred within the intelligence agency some of which may have occurred in other part of the executive branch or some of which may have occurred in Congress because of decision that have been made over here so that we get that full picture of what went on of HILL Right REP HOEKSTRA That will all be those are all area that you plan on looking at of HILL I mean the game plan so to speak is to look at the actual review get through that then look at the system issue and then decide how those system issue can be addressed through reform And what you re talking about I think would be in the system issue problem restriction on our ability to penetrate human source hum in and then where we go from here in term of reform REP HOEKSTRA Good Thank you Or Chairman I yield back my time SEN GRAHAM Thank you very much Senator Shelby SEN SHELBY Thank you Is Will I ve missed some of this because like everybody we have to do other thing during the meeting Would it be fair to say at this point in the inquiry the investigation that we re a long way from finishing our inquiry are we not of HILL I like to look at it I like to be optimistic rather than pessimistic And I would say I think we ve made a significant good start down the road SEN SHELBY Well I think we ve of HILL He re not finished but you know I think we ve done a fair amount of work here and we re getting we have a good record on the fact so far SEN SHELBY But you re a veteran investigator a veteran prosecution inspector general at DOD He all know this and we have a lot of respect for you But in any investigation you do n t know what s going to turn up next do you of HILL Right SEN SHELBY And you re not telling u here today and the American people that you see the end of this investigation of HILL To I think I said previously in response to another question that in any investigation the more you dig you find thing and then you have to have time to go through those thing SEN SHELBY Analyze it of HILL And we are that ha happened It s happening just like it happens in any investigation And we re trying to follow those fact where they lead Now whether all of that will be finished by whenever this is determined to end I do n t know But I think we ll make a significant contribution and will have made a good SEN SHELBY I think you re already making a significant contribution and I think the staff is By concern is that we do n t know what we do n t know of HILL Correct SEN SHELBY And I have the feeling that there s more out there because I raised this morning I raised the issue in opening statement that I do n t believe a a member of the committee that we ve had the utmost support by the agency that we re investigation And I do n t believe that we ve had the support that wa promised at the outset you know by the administration Having said that I want to focus just what little time I have on the FBI You may have talked about this earlier I know you addressed it and that is the analytical component of the FBI of HILL Right SEN SHELBY He know that the FBI ha got good people He know that they re great on investigation They have no peer I believe of HILL Right SEN SHELBY But on analysis of intelligence information some of u have been on the committee and this is my eighth year here that we ve been concerned with that for a long time It s hard to put an intelligence division or component together and make it work Well u in your judgment what wa the state of the analytical component of the FBI before September the th from what you know of HILL Well on terrorist basically yeah SEN SHELBY Is far a terrorist is concerned of HILL The FBI I mean our figure we have the figure in the statement they I think had one individual working on al Qaeda SEN SHELBY One individual working al Qaeda before September the th in the analysis of HILL Analysis right And you know my own personal view and you alluded to it and I have worked with the FBI for many many year SEN SHELBY I know you have of HILL starting when I wa a prosecution and I agree with you I think they are tremendous investigator And in term of law enforcement they can be the best on some case in prosecution But that s their mission Their mission is to do an investigation to do a prosecution to do a case Of it s their case and their mission their prosecution they will go to the th degree And they re very aggressive and we need that But they are not at least in my experience their training and their mission doe not focus on going beyond that into the broader analytical world and looking at the big picture They are focused on their case And it s too bad because their aggressiveness would be very good if they could also channel it at least on issue like terrorist a little broader onto the analytical SEN SHELBY Well before September th they only had one person in the whole bureau working on that you just testified to Is that correct In al Qaeda of HILL Yeah And I just have a note from our staff who ha done a lot of these interview that it wa at the FBI they had one individual doing strategic analysis is what we re talking about SEN SHELBY That s right of HILL They did have some others that were doing a she call operational analysis which I interpret that to mean that wa connected with prosecution and case To there were individual doing that SEN SHELBY To we think that there is a way to get the FBI changed or at least part of it toward strategic analysis of information dealing with terrorist in the future I know we talked to the director about this But that s harder to do than it is to say is n t it of HILL Well I think it s not only getting them to expand their focus I mean it s like any job or profession in an agency They have to be able to give people incentive in term of career and profession and those sort of thing to make the analysis position in the FBI important position that people want to do SEN SHELBY One of my light is on I guess I ll I ll wait another round Or Chairman REP GOSS Is Pelosi REP PELOSI Thank you very much Or Chairman I want to join others in commending Is Will on the excellent work that she and the member of her very able staff have performed I hope I hope that it is a comfort to the family to know how persistent and thorough this staff is in this investigation in this inquiry however limited it is strictly to intelligence And a wa mentioned earlier there are other agency of government beyond the intelligence community that need some review a well The question of could it have been prevented of course is one that will haunt u a long a we exist a a country And there s no good answer The good news is the bad news Of the answer is no it could not have been prevented that mean we re very exposed in the future Of it mean yes it could have been prevented that s good news because that bodes well for the future but it s a tragedy obviously for the family It s a tragedy in any event but if it could have been prevented we ll all be haunted by the guilt associated with that And that s not even good enough punishment for u There will be hell to that s going up to September th Most September th if any of these agency of government in the intelligence community are not dealing honestly with u and by that I mean being forthcoming with information if a Or Shelby say there s other information to come that we do n t know about now I believe there will be hell to pay for them because we all assume that everyone is doing their best to protect our country and they must help u get to the bottom of this I trust that they are helping u all they can but we must continue the inquiry I think a one who originally supported an independent commission I wa original author of it and we passed in committee we failed on the floor the idea I think is an important one However it doe not in any way undermine the important work of this inquiry Is Or Former ha said and others have said this piece of it that go into the intelligence committee is very important He could have had the best intelligence in the world though and what we found out wa that since September th is that the hijacker and the al Qaeda knew something about u that we did not know about ourselves and that is that we had tremendous exposure at the airport That all four of these hijacking could have been successful is remarkable I find it remarkable that maybe one would get by but four of them to succeed in their word succeed is remarkable to me To my question to you Is Will is on this subject your report is clear but I would just like to see if you could shed some further light Is you were looking into this issue of the hijacker and we ll go more into it in a couple of day but did you see a distinction made between hacking of course tat s a predictable threat to u and using airplane a weapon a two distinct threat Because from our perspective many of u a hacking is still the loss of many many life and should have been taken a seriously a hacking with intent to do further damage of HILL Well we certainly when we went out looking for information and requesting information from the agency distinguished it because we were asking for information on the use of aircraft a weapon To that would imply more than the usual just jack a plane to get somewhere or take hostage or whatever But in term of you know being prepared to address it and your comment about why you know why they were able to jack all four of these plan and our defense were down there s probably le of a distinction And I point to the FAA FBI assessment that we quote in this staff statement I think that year which wa I believe they were looking at the whole threat terrorist threat to civil aviation To they were not distinguishing between aircraft a weapon or hacking And what wa interesting about it is that they were concluding that there wa a small domestic threat so they were not too concerned about any sort of terrorist threat to domestic U S aviation here in the United States a late a REP PELOSI Well I find that to be a serious shortcoming of HILL Right REP PELOSI separate and apart from not knowing the time and place and date of HILL Right REP PELOSI the fact that the entire threat wa minimize to that extent To I do see the need a I had said before to ass the performance of any agency beyond the intelligence agency which have a responsibility to protect act of terrorist and to look with fresh eye and some innovative thinking on our intelligence and all other aspect of protecting the American people in this regard And of course a Senator Rockefeller said we must do it right But I think doing it right also mean protecting our civil liberty To we have quite a challenge And your presentation this morning and the work of your staff ha been a valuable contribution Thank you of HILL Thank you REP PELOSI I look forward to following hearing Thank you Or Chairman SEN GRAHAM Thank you Is Pelosi Or Loss REP GOSS Thank you Met me advise member of the House that there s minute left on a vote in the House so my wrap up will be very quick First of all I want to thank Is Will for a very excellent presentation of HILL Thank you REP GOSS I liked the version that we had before it had been reacted better and I expect that we are going to continue to press on because I do believe that there is more that can be revealed And along that area is it fair for me to make a statement that because of the joint staff we now know some thing that we otherwise certainly would not have known Is that a fair statement of HILL I would hope so yes I would say so REP GOSS That is certainly my feeling a well And I hope that much of that can be shared with the American people The second question I wanted to ask or provide some guidance on from my perspective is in your excellent report this morning on intelligence reporting on bin Laden s intention to strike inside the United States on page and of your report and were a series of specific that cry out to say Why wa all this ignored There wa the audience Why wa nobody listening And one of the issue that I would like to have further amplification on this is if this wa percent of the reporting what wa the other percent of the reporting that wa consuming the analysis time in the intelligence community I m not asking for an answer now of HILL Right REP GOSS I think that is going to be helpful for our report The next question I think is self evident and others have said it There s no doubt that some of the question member here have addressed today to you are more appropriate for witness that will be forthcoming and I want to make sure that we understand that there will be other witness forthcoming and we will try and have a much of that a public a we can a it should be But the very penetrating question that were asked by Is Breitweiser and Or Rush and the recommendation I think are an excellent point and each one of them deserves consideration and we ll get them at some point In fact some of them have already been given consideration a I m sure you know And finally with regard to the remark about Senator Even and Senator Rockefeller on classification my view is that the burden is on the administration to tell u why we must preserve classification unless it s in those area those exempt area that I spoke to source method plan and intention and going prosecution by the Justice Department The final point I would make is that the work of this committee will be done There is no question about that And there will continue to be oversight by the United States Congress in a number of area including in the intelligence committee no matter who the member are of that committee To this is an issue that is not going to be dropped merely because another date lip up on a calendar or there is a change of personnel somewhere in the establishment His will go forward because the American people deserve the answer and they will get the answer And I thank you very much for your participation today and an excellent job Is Will of HILL Thank you REP GOSS Thank you Or Chairman SEN GRAHAM Thank you Or Loss Senator Feinstein SEN FEINSTEIN Thank you very much Or Chairman I certainly concur with the remark that have been made about the excellence of the report of HILL Thank you SEN FEINSTEIN I m just sorry I could n t get it until the meeting so I had to spend my time reading it during the meeting which Or Chairman I would suggest is not the best way of enabling u to carry out our duty SEN GRAHAM Senator a you know we made the original non reacted version available in both the House and the Senate Intelligence Committee room and I understand that you took advantage of that Unfortunately it wa only within the last le than hour that we got back from the classification agency the version that we could make public I hope that in the future we and they will do a better job and a more expedition job so that will give u an opportunity to know what s going to be public with more lead time SEN FEINSTEIN I thank you Or Chairman Is Will on December the th the DCI told his deputy in a meme about bin Laden and al Qaeda that He are at war I want no resource or people spared in this effort either inside CIA or the community Met in your testimony you indicate that when it came time to translate that declaration of war into real resource the government s effort fell joyfully short Specifically you concluded that the allocation of intelligence community resource did not adequately reflect the true war against bin Laden For example you point out in the CTC at CIA had only three analysis assigned to the bin Laden network worldwide And after that number had risen to just five and that thing were even worse outside the CIA The international terrorist analysis unit at the FBI had in place only one analyst to address al Qaeda this out of an intelligent budget of literally billion of dollar every year Now it really concern me because I wa one that felt very strongly that the warning that something wa going to happen were there and certainly by July I wa just based on what I heard in this committee percent certain that something wa going to happen I even said that on national television that I thought it wa going to happen within the next three month And my question really go to the fact that whether today even we have enough to do what we need to do why do you think so little attention even after these declaration of war were really paid when it came to devoting real resource and what wa taking a higher priority of HILL I I think we have asked that to many people in the community and I will give you again I have to be careful the detail of it because we are in a public session But I think what we are hearing is that there were other priority that the intelligence one reaction would be that people would tell you that the intelligence community responds to it customer customer being other part of government that are taking them to come up with intelligence on certain item and that in some respect there were customer that they had to satisfy they felt they had to satisfy and were told to satisfy on other topic other than al Qaeda To that wa one issue that we ve heard He have heard in the FBI on this the resource There wa a we just discussed with Senator Shelby there wa not many there wa like one strategic analyst for al Qaeda in the FBI There were some more analysis on operation and there wa a much bigger emphasis in the FBI on operation on case investigation a opposed to strategic analysis even though it wa on al Qaeda which wa a high threat But their mission wa more focused on actual prosecution and case To I think a with any resource issue it wa a question of other priority customer demanding other thing and the agency responding to them SEN FEINSTEIN To you believe that today there are sufficient resource of HILL He have not senator you know we know some of the detail a to how thing have jumped since September th in term of resource but we have not focused intently on what is going on post September th because our job ha been to try and find out what wa happening before September th To I would n t I really would not feel probably qualified to start guessing a to whether it s adequate now SEN FEINSTEIN In page SEN GRAHAM Senator we will have another round after this round SEN FEINSTEIN I do n t even get the time our question took up Never mind Thank you SEN GRAHAM Senator Nikolski SEN MIKULSKI Thank you very much Or Chairman Or Chairman a few word to the family and then a question for Is Will To the family first of all my name is Barbara Nikolski I am a United States senator and I am from the state of Maryland I had people die at the World Trade Enter and I also had Marylanders die at the Pentagon in the plane and in the inferior there I also believe I owe my life to the gallantry of the men and woman who fought on because I do believe the plane wa heading towards u And I have two constituent who died in the anthrax attack on u To know that I am absolutely on your side And I want you to know that I thank you today for coming because you show such inspiration strength and courage and I believe you have a right to know about what happened you have a right to be heard in any public forum and I believe Americans have a right to be protected I know that you are still looking for answer on why this happened how it happened and how it doe n t happen again Now I would support a vote to establish an independent commission I believe my committee ha done an outstanding job But I believe when such an impact happens to America and it family we need more than one opinion on how to make sure it never happens again That I find I find many thing about what happened troubling But what I find most troubling is that four of the terrorist were stopped by local law enforcement four for speeding and one for not having a driver s license They were actually in the hand of law enforcement But when they were stopped and the police went to check the database nothing averted them to detain these men Something is wrong here State trooper like the one in my own state that stopped one of these thus and other police officer know more when they check their database know more about men being behind in their child support the database will tell them than they do about men who are possibly around a terrorist attack There are more than different watch list to keep track of people dangerous to the United States But guess what if you are a watch list you do n t talk to other watch list Of you are a watch list you like live in one of those case You might not know if there are other watch list out there You do n t tell anyone that you are a watch list and you certainly do n t talk to each other make friend with the other watch list or make friend with law enforcement That s really I think unacceptable And these will be the question I am going to direct to Is Will because like you I want to be sure that this committee get answer for you and the rest of America on how we can detect deter disrupt and defeat any attack on the United States of America And having said that Is Will you know about these watch list you know that they are all over the place and they are nowhere In our work with you and my colleague I wanted to see if there wa a smoking gun I wanted to know what were the system problem and what were the solution I am not sure there is a smoking gun but these watch list are definitely a system problem Would you elaborate them the one you can or where you would see solution are going on the watch list of HILL The watch list issue senator we are I am aware of it He are going to go into that in more detail when we get to the hearing on the hijacker because a you alluded to that is an issue regarding Midhar and Alhamzi I mean that s a very big issue It s an issue of getting it on the right watch list getting it to the right people But even before that it s also an issue of getting it between the intelligence community and the law enforcement community and breaking down the reluctance sometimes to share information across the from the intelligence community to the criminal investigator and law enforcement on the other side And that I think may also play on some of this To but those are issue that we will talk about when we look at the hijacker case And you are right they are a problem SEN MIKULSKI Well let me just say this before the yellow go to red I raised the issue of a smoking gun I have been in many hearing To you believe that there is a smoking gun on what went wrong or wa it just a series of total disconnected of HILL Well we of course I am handicapped in answering that because we are in a public session and we are still looking at a number of other issue that have come up But I do n t think in any of what we have seen here smoking gun if you mean by smoking gun that somebody had information of when where how this wa going to happen in the United States government we have not found that But you know I had a discussion actually with one of our staff on this the other day and he pointed out wisely that there ha been so much discussion about looking for a smoking gun The truth is you hardly ever get a quote smoking gun in not just terrorist but in a criminal case et center et center And if by rousing all the time on we have the smoking gun you know we have to be ready to go if we have a smoking gun the truth is most of the time you will never have a smoking gun and it is a lot harder to find it when you do n t have one To what we ought to be rousing on is how to get our system ready to find these gun when you do n t have a smoking gun which is what you are going to be faced with most of the time just you know the odds are you are not going to have that And we need to have our intelligence and law enforcement people good enough and bright enough and aggressive enough that they can track these gun down and find this even when there is no smoking gun because my own experience at least in law enforcement is that s what you have most of the time SEN MIKULSKI Thank you SEN GRAHAM Thank you senator Senator By And Senator By ha submitted an opening statement which will be placed in the record SEN KYL Thank you Or Chairman By the way I think that last point is a very important point that need to be underscored and it s one of the most important thing that come from this from your statement today Is Will of HILL Thank you senator SEN KYL I wa this morning detained in my office waiting for a couple of phone call but I had my television on the entire time and wa privileged to hear not only the statement of the chairman of our committee but also the statement made by Is Breitweiser and Or Rush And a ha been expressed by others here my heart go out to them and the family and family that they represent And I think that I should state that I am certain that every American share their grief and their anger and even their frustration And I also share their view that there s more we could have done to try to prevent the terrorist we experienced on September th I also agree with Cleaner Will that at the end of the day it is doubtful we will ever find a smoking gun But a she said the important point is to be in a better position to deal with the other piece of information in order to try to prevent this in the future I do think Or Chairman that it is very unclear whether the joint investigation the joint committee investigation that we are engaged in here and whatever report we eventually submit will satisfy these witness and those that they represent or whether they will satisfy member of this committee let alone the other member of the House and the Senate Is you know Or Chairman I have expressed serious reservation about the direction of our investigation including the allocation of time and resource to holding open hearing at this time before we have finished our work Ours is a large undertaking and we have got a lot more work to do before our fast approaching deadline And yet we are proceeding with public hearing in spite of not having completed that investigation That wa presented today wa only a staff document I am talking now about the testimony of Is Will It wa not a consensus product The committee member had no practical input into this interim report I think the public should know Ordinarily we investigate we write our report and then we present our recommendation The staff s presentation of it interim report before member getting is therefore in my view premature a well a a diversion of the joint staff from the investigation that we have given them the job to do The interim statement from our joint inquiry staff provides some very valuable information about what ha been done to date a chronology of event leading to the September th attack and some background information about the growing threat of al Qaeda over the last decade It is very useful to have this history and it s important to make it public But the committee should have approved it first And in any event the release of the report could have been done without taking the time to have it read by the staff director But more importantly I believe that question fundamental to our investigation have yet to be pursued adequately These include include but are not limited to whether part of the pre September th problem wa a result of a culture of risk aversion in the intelligence community and or an inadequate allocation and improper prioritization of resource to those on the front line of our counterterror effort Or Chairman you know I have expressed before my concern that committee member have been able to play only a limited role in this inquiry It s largely being conducted by the joint committee staff with little input by or to our own committee staff let alone the member themselves And that will make it difficult to concur in the final product without reservation He will not know what we have n t been told and therefore we will not be able to touch unequivocal for the final product Questions about this investigation process have led to call for the creation of a national commission to investigate all of these matter His would further stress the intelligence community at the very time we are trying to fight the war on terrorist While it may be deemed necessary it can hardly be deemed desirable To I hope Or Chairman that we can continue to work to resolve these issue Only by doing our very best will we have done our duty to the victim who are represented here today and to the American people SEN GRAHAM Senator thank you Senator May is supposed to be en route Of Senator Shelby ha SEN SHELBY Of you will let me ask until he come SEN GRAHAM And then I have a couple of question I am going to ask at the conclusion of Senator May s question Senator Shelby SEN SHELBY Mrs Will I would like to go back to the FBI and the analytical component we were talking about earlier of HILL Right right SEN SHELBY or lack thereof In your investigation regarding the analytical ability of the FBI do you know if the FBI prior to September the th ever did an analysis of terrorist tactic That is terrorist tactic with the possible use of airplane a weapon of HILL I do n t believe so He a I think SEN SHELBY You re saying no of HILL Is the statement say we have n t found any analysis of the use of aircraft a weapon in the community a far a I know including the FBI SEN SHELBY In the community you are talking about the intelligence community of HILL Yeah but we would include SEN SHELBY Not just the FBI of HILL Right I think it s safe to say the FBI also SEN SHELBY Now in your statement I believe it s on page not without reading it all and I ll quote some of it It say In April the intelligence community obtained information regarding an alleged bin Laden threat to jack a The source wa a walk in to the FBI s Newark office claiming that he had been to a training camp in Pakistan where he learned hacking technique and received arm training He also stated that he wa supposed to meet five or six other individual in the U S who would participate in the plot And I ll read further They were instructed to use all necessary force to take over the plane because there would be pilot among the hacking team The plan wa to fly the plane to Afghanistan and if they could not make it there they would blow up the plane His is part of your report is that right of HILL Right SEN SHELBY Now were they I believe there wa another report August according to page of your report In August of the intelligence community obtained information regarding a plot to either bomb the U S Embassy in Nairobi from an airplane or crash an airplane into it The intelligence community learned that two people who were reportedly acting on instruction from bin Laden met in October to discus this plot And then we go back and you ve touched on this I believe I know we ve had hearing on it About the Philippine situation of HILL Right SEN SHELBY There there wa information that they could use airplane a weapon and so forth of HILL Right correct SEN SHELBY In the light of part of your statement I just referred to you re saying that they re according to your investigation there wa not any analysis of these terrorist tactic in the intelligence community regarding the of HILL There wa no there wa no analysis of the likelihood of the use of airplane a weapon a a terrorist tactic SEN SHELBY I wonder why not of HILL I would hypothesis that what I mean when we we ve asked question of people It s a resource issue People say they were overwhelmed The other thing and I mentioned this earlier I do n t think anyone had pulled a we did I mean the reason the way we got this information is by going to the agency and saying we want everything you have on the use of aircraft a weapon To we have then pulled out of this huge amount of data they have and come up with enough to show that there wa this trend and this theme going through some of the reporting SEN SHELBY His wa not on September th something new or should n t have been something new His wa stuff that had been out there at least since before then and I believe you talked about the Paris incident where the French of HILL The Differ Power SEN SHELBY Oh yeah the Differ Power deal the Philippine deal these reporting that you listed To when people come up and they say Most we were shocked that they would use weapon use airplane a weapon and we did n t do any analysis of that in the community are you kind of shocked or surprised of HILL Well it wa there I mean the information wa there SEN SHELBY The information wa there if they had it analyzed a far a the potential tactic of the hijacker is that right of HILL Yeah I mean based on what we ve seen this wa not a new idea a of September th SEN SHELBY Thank you Or Chairman SEN GRAHAM Senator Urban SEN RICHARD DURBIN D of Thank you Or Chairman And I apologize for not being here earlier but I had a Judiciary Committee hearing which ran in conflict with this hearing today And I thank you Or Chairman Senator Shelby and our counterpart in the House for the time that we put into this effort and your leadership in bringing u to this moment I personally feel that we have identified some thing of value in term of shortcoming from the government s point of view prior to September th He have identified a lack of communication among the intelligence agency and I m afraid that today although there s been an improvement there is still much room for improvement I have focused primarily on the issue of information technology and I have been chagrined and disappointed by the report about the lack of coordination of the computer architecture of the federal government so that agency intelligence agency can share information effectively Governor Ridge referred to this a a force multiplied and it would be but it is not because of those shortcoming He have also considered the result of those shortcoming and not the least of which wa the example of the Phoenix meme which should have been but wa not brought to the attention of or analyzed by counter terrorist force That meme might might have at least helped u to be better prepared for what occurred on September th though I do n t want to suggest that anyone saw this coming in it specific but it s certainly raised question which should have been pursued and were not I think recalling some of the testimony we received there wa clearly a lack of follow up at the FBI and a lack of involvement by the CIA The same thing hold true for the Moussaoui arrest and the disclosure that came out of the FBI afterwards again evincing a lack of coordination a lack of sharing of vital information that could have had u better prepared to defend America Those two instance though I would like to bring to the attention of this joint inquiry have come to the public eye because of lead lead by the administration lead from Capitol Will of vital information It strike me a unwise and unfair for u to expect there to be a thorough investigation of what led up to September th based on the possibility of lead coming from anywhere History ha told u that it is far better to have a public hearing a public investigation and the involvement of third party when it come to signing blame and perhaps suggesting meaningful and painful reform but that ha not been the case here I think we are doing what we set out to do to try to find way to improve the working of the intelligence community to avoid a future September th but we will never be able to satisfy the need and curiosity of the American people about whether their government did everything it could to protect them in closed hearing with occasional lead That is not going to serve the need of America Applause I know that earlier today there wa testimony of one of the widow of a victim of September th and I have met in my office with some of those same victim and the family in painful meeting There is an anger and a sadness in the message that they bring to Congress but there is certainly I think wisdom in what they ve suggested Met u do our business here let u try to find even within closed hearing way to improve the intelligence committee and community but let s not forget our primary obligation to the people of this country He do not serve the need of an open society with closed hearing in relation to an attack on America virtually unprecedented in our history It is time for u to acknowledge the obvious He need a third party investigation people that we can trust who have no political animus who are going to come to this a loyal Americans to try to help u be a safer nation I commend the staff They have done heroic work and I know have worked long and hard to bring the report that we have today And we should continue to meet our mandate a best we can but let u not believe that this chapter ha been closed in American history He have merely addressed the forward with this investigation now we must get into the substance and do it in a public way That s not to diminish any of the effort of my colleague or anyone on this committee but I think we owe it to the American people to give them more Thank you Or Chairman SEN GRAHAM I would like to ask a question and then make a comment The question ha to do with the relationship between intelligence and effecting the operation of a governmental agency You have five or more page in which you outline the example of the use of commercial aviation a a weapon of mass destruction Is I understand the history generally the taking of an airplane by hijacker ha been done for either a political or an economic purpose that in light of that the standard protocol what a crew is supposed to do if they are subjected to hacking is to cooperate to acquiesce to try to get the airplane on the ground and then start the process of negotiating with the hijacker From your review is that an accurate statement of HILL Yes I think that s correct and that wa traditionally the way you would deal with a hacking SEN GRAHAM And I believe it wa reflected in the way in which the first three plane that were hacked on September th reacted It wa not until the information of the first three plane became known to the person on the fourth plane that there wa a resistance to the hijacker and a a result the plane crashed in Pennsylvania With the kind of intelligence information that there might be a shift in the way in which hijacker and aircraft interrelated that is instead of taking the airplane for a political or economic purpose that the plane itself might be converted into a weapon and used in the horrified manner that it wa Was that information from the intelligence community transmitted to either the FAA or the commercial aviation industry so that it might affect the way in which they advise crew a to how to respond to a hacking of HILL I ca n t say that all that information wa transmitted to the FAA The FAA did get some of it and we talk about their analysis of the threat to civil aviation By own read on it is I do n t think that to the extent the FAA got the information there wa a real recognition that this wa a serious threat I mean certainly you re correct I mean if they had changed their focus from hacking for ransom or to take the plane and fly it somewhere else or hostage or whatever if that had changed to the use of an aircraft a a weapon you would have had to change the entire midst and training that wa given to the flight crew for instance and the security in the plane and everything and that obviously did not happen because a of September th you re absolutely correct it did n t happen on September th until evidently the passenger in the fourth plane became aware of what wa going on but that wa not the flight crew up to that point I assume were following the standard protocol for dealing with a hacking But that issue underscore the importance of someone recognizing in the community the intelligence community that this wa a serious threat and there wa a stream of information there and that perhaps it wa serious enough and the likelihood wa serious enough that they needed to address not only dissemination it but telling policymakers in those other agency that this wa a threat they now had to be prepared to meet SEN GRAHAM One of my criticism of the threat that are being issued to the general public including the one within the last two week is that what s lacking is the follow on of what is the citizen who receives this information that they re living in a heightened threat environment supposed to do to protect themselves their family their community And here we have a case of where intelligence information wa sent to a sophisticated industry commercial aviation apparently without any direction a to how the industry should use the information and the consequence wa they did n t use the information and that contributed to what happened on September th I d like to ask if we might pursue that issue because I think it is a metaphor for the larger issue of how do you get intelligence from the theoretical to actually affecting the way people function and how they use that information to reduce their vulnerability to a particular threat Senator Feinstein SENATOR FEINSTEIN I think Senator define wa before me Or Chairman SEN GRAHAM Oh I m sorry Senator define I m sorry SEN DEWINE Or Chairman I do n t have any further question Thank you SEN GRAHAM Senator Feinstein SEN FEINSTEIN May I Or Chairman Is Will of HILL Yes Senator SEN FEINSTEIN I wanted to kind of follow up on where I wa trying to go with this The year wa a very big year in the early spring with a lot of piece of intelligence coming in In reading your report the year also appears to have been a very big year for all kind of piece And I wanted to see if we could n t go into some of those piece a little bit more There contained on page on your written statement you talk about the use of front for terrorist activity talk about flying an aircraft loaded with explosive into an airport and decorating it Ll Qaeda wa trying to establish an operative cell within the United States A bin Laden plot involving aircraft in New Work and Washington Recruiting a group of five to seven young men from the United States to travel to the Middle Last for training Reward money for assassination of four top intelligence agency officer and on like that And then of course the war that wa declared in the CIA of HILL Right SEN FEINSTEIN An you go into any more detail on any of these individual piece of intelligence and how they were used from an intelligence perspective to try to weave an intelligence web Because it seems to me with this and then unfortunately in July of with the Phoenix meme and then in August with Moussaoui and I do n t know what wa in his computer or in his possession but I would suggest if you took those piece and the other piece one might be able to weave together a rather significant scheme An you give u any more information of HILL I ca n t I do n t think I can give you more information on the actual report because a I mentioned at the outset the language that we have in this statement is what ha been classified To to venture beyond that language that is the language that the classification group basically signed off on a suitable for public release I ca n t go into much more detail about the language of the report He did go on some of these to the FBI and asked them what they did with some of this information or what happened to it when the report came in if they got it and I can tell you some of them and we ve given them a whole list and some we still have not gotten response They are still trying to find out what they did or locate the record Others they have found For instance I think you mentioned the information concerning a bin Laden plot involving aircraft in New Work and Washington The FBI I can tell you did receive that information and they worked actually with local law enforcement to try to verify the report but they were not able to corroborate the report and took no further action is what we have been told In September we had one where we did get a response from the FBI His wa the one about that they obtained information that bin Laden s next operation could involve flying an aircraft loaded with explosive into a U S airport and decorating it He asked the FBI if they got that information and what did they do with it They did receive the information and they also worked with another agency government agency to try to verify the information The source of the information said that another individual had advanced knowledge of some of bin Laden s operation and had given him the information about bin Laden s attack or this report The FBI tell u that they tried to work with other agency and did verify portion of this account but they were not able to locate the individual who reportedly had the advanced knowledge And after September th they actually went back to this report and tried to locate that individual again and were unable to do so To what we tried to do when we got these report that we felt were significant wa we tried particularly the one there were many in involving domestic U S attack and on those we went back to the FBI a I said and have asked them Did you get the report what did you do to verify it or did you take any action and they have come back to u on some of them Some of them there are a number of them they are still trying to go through their record and come up with an answer a to whether they got it and if so what they did with it But those two are example of the type of thing we re getting from them SEN FEINSTEIN Thank you Or Chairman just one quick comment if I might I think this report becomes kind of a basic prime on I m sure more will be filled in a time go on but I find it a very valuable document in establishing a chronology of what wa known when it wa known the fragmentary message that come through here and my hope is a these hearing go on and particularly when we get to the Phoenix meme and the Moussaoui case that we might be able to ask some question and I do n t know in public session if we will about if there had been a FISA warrant on Moussaoui and the information made available whether that would have been substantial enough to really ring a very strong bell But I wanted to thank the staff and Is Will and also thank the victim who were here today It s very special and I hope you know that we really do care and that you really do have our sympathy and our determination to get at the heart of it SEN GRAHAM And Senator I share those comment and I would say that within the next week or ten day we will have a further specific hearing on the issue that surround the Moussaoui case and that would be a very excellent opportunity to bore in at the level of detail that you ve indicated your interested in I did n t get a chance in my first round to make my comment so I will do so unless anyone doe anyone have any remaining question To this will be the last word To me one of the lesson that we have been learning and today we learned it at a new depth is how difficult it is to get an organization which ha been doing it business important business in a particular pattern for an extended period of time to be flexible enough to recognize that the environment ha shifted and it is going to have to change it pattern of business In the case of the intelligence agency they were a child born in and grew up in the Old War Very experience that the U S intelligence service had wa a post experience because we did n t have any civilian intelligence service in the United States prior to I contrast that with for instance the British who have had an intelligence service since the Napoleonic Wars To it is not surprising that when the Old War ended the agency continued to act pretty much the way they did while the Old War wa still underway because that wa the only environment in which they d ever function or known He ve had some example I think in the report that Is Will ha given u today the difficulty in establishing priority Even though we declared that terrorist and Same bin Laden specifically wa such an adversary that we were at war with him we did n t change resource commensurate with that decision He did not recognize that terrorist wa now becoming a domestic threat because historically we thought of terrorist a something that happened abroad and the new creative us that the hijacker were about to make of commercial milliner To longer were they passive instrument to try to use to secure money or some political advantage they had themselves become a weapon of mass destruction To I see a one of our challenge a we move from what we are learning to what we are going to prescribe for the future is to how can we build in to our intelligence community a greater capability of internal adapting He certainly do n t want to leave this issue for the future that will require a repetition of September the th to get to grab u by the sleeve and say you know you ve got to change because your old way are threatening the security of the American people And how we go about doing that I suggest will be one of our major task and if we are successful one of our major accomplishment Of there is no further statement a I indicated earlier the record will be open for hour if anyone ha any additional material they would like to submit I want to especially thank the family who are represented here today and especially to Written who I see is still with u and also Stephen for their excellent presentation which started our

these committee Before I proceed with my statement I have a long written statement which I would like to submit for the record and I am going to morally summarize it given the length of what we have here SEN GRAHAM Your full statement will appear in the record of HILL Thank you But before I get into the main part of the statement I do want to make clear to you and member of the committee that the information that is in this statement that we are going to present this morning ha been cleared for public release And a I think most of you know much of the information that our staff ha been working on over the last several month is obviously highly classified or ha been highly classified In the course of the last two month we have been working with the intelligence community in a long and what I would call a very arduous process to classify much of the information that we have reviewed and that we believe is important to the public s understanding of why the intelligence community did not know of the September th attack in advance And I would point out that that process we want to say for the record that we appreciate the many long hour that have been put into that process in what I believe for the most part ha been very constructive cooperation with the executive branch on that process A good number of professional from the community have been in working group and have gone over with our staff the detail of this information to put it in a form where it could be released publicly To there have we have made very good progress But I do need to report that by late last night we were able to resolve all but two issue about relevant information two issue where we believed relevant information to the inquiry ha not yet despite our discussion with the executive branch been classified And I want to make reference to those two issue because this statement ha been prepared recognizing that those two area remain classified The two area are any reference to the intelligence community providing information to the president or the White House and the identity of and information on a key al Qaeda leader involved in the September th attack According to the White House and the DCI director of central intelligence the president s knowledge of intelligence information relevant to this inquiry remains classified even when the substance of that intelligence information ha been classified With respect to the key al Qaeda leader involved in the September th attack I am advised this morning that the White House and not the DCI ha declined to classify his identity despite an enormous volume of medium reporting on this individual that ha been out there for some time The joint inquiry staff disagrees on both of those issue He believe the public ha an interest in this information and that public disclosure would not harm national security However a I believe you know we do not have the independent authority to classify intelligence information short of a lengthy procedure in the U S Congress And we therefore have prepared this statement without detailed description of our work in those two area REP TIM ROEMER D of Or Chairman A parliamentary inquiry SEN GRAHAM Or Former REP ROEMER Are the committee bound by the classification decision made in these two instance SEN GRAHAM It is our advice from staff director and counsel that we do not independently have the authority to classify material and therefore we are constrained by the decision made by those who have that legal responsibility REP ROEMER A further parliamentary inquiry Or Chairman Is there a process then that either the committee or the Congress can undertake to challenge a classification decision such a that SEN GRAHAM The answer is yes And I would like Is Will alluded to the fact that there wa such a process I think she described it a being cumbersome Of you or counsel might briefly explain what the option is to Congress of HILL Or Chairman I am not an expert on the committee process Is I understand it from speaking with the full committee counsel on this it is it would require the Congress to you would have to have a vote I am not sure the full Congress or the Senate or House but there s a vote involved You would have to run it through The Congress itself would have to overrule that classification decision The reason that we did not originate this information under the classification decision the agency that originates it make the classification and declassifies it And in this instance that would not be the Congress To the only alternative would be to go through this rather what I am told is a lengthy rather prolonged process I should point out that right before the hearing this morning I wa advised by the White House that they were going to look at these two issue again and they thought they would review it again within the next hour And I advised them that if their position change please to advise the committee and we could always issue a supplemented statement on those two issue for the record To I my assumption is they are still reviewing it REP ROEMER A final parliamentary inquiry Or Chairman Does the chairman intend to have this committee consider or debate that kind of process I am not advocating that we challenge it at this point but certainly understanding more from the joint inquiry staff that strongly disagrees with the decision a to why it might be helpful in a deliberative sense for the committee SEN GRAHAM I think there are two question in your inquiry One is whether we might consider utilizing the currently existing process in this or future instance in which we have a disagreement a to whether the information which is being withheld is in fact classified information i e that it relates to the national security The second question might be a part of our final report we might want to recommend to our colleague a change in the law that relates to the congressional role in classification so that it would be more available a an alternative in the event that there wa a disagreement between Congress and an executive clarifying agency REP ROEMER Well Or Chairman thank you I hope we do have a robust discussion of this and I appreciate your patience REP NANCY PELOSI D of Or Chairman SEN GRAHAM Yes Is Pelosi REP PELOSI Or Chairman I wish thank you Or Chairman I want to join you in your earlier comment commending Cleaner Will and Sick Sikagon oh and the joint inquiry staff for their fine work And I want to inquire if it s possible just on this point that the parliamentary inquiry that Or Former brought up Of Is Will could just clarify it say any reference to the intelligence community providing information to the president or the White House Would you give u an example of that of HILL That we are referring to it s obvious and it s clear a you go through this statement that I am about to present that we are talking about a number of intelligence report which we have had classified through this process And part of our role wa not just looking at what wa the reporting but where the reporting went And you will note that this statement includes many intelligence report and in some instance they were provided to senior government official I believe is the wording that s used But there is no reference on any of the page a to whether the president received that information or not And we have been told that that information in other word not what is in the report but whether or not it went to the president would be classified under this decision REP PELOSI And when you say the president you mean any president historically of HILL That s correct And clearly if you look at the statement the reporting ha date on it and the reporting is not just reporting that would have been under the current administration but also reporting that wa made under the prior administration And the decision in fairness obviously to the White House it is not simply a to this sitting president but a to any president REP PELOSI Well I would hope Or Chairman whoever is presiding here that Or Former s comment will be taken seriously by the chairman and that the committee should consider their option under existing committee rule to make this information public depending on how it go in the next hour And I would I think that the White House should be aware that there is strong interest among many of u to have this be the most open process possible in fairness to those family who were affected we heard from this morning and really in the interest of a democratic society Thank you Or Chairman REP LAHOOD Or Chairman REP GOSS Chairman Graham had to step out for a moment he ll be back But I assure you Is Pelosi that he will be attentive to that request a will I Is it a point of inquiry or on this matter REP LAHOOD In this matter REP GOSS Or LaHood REP LAHOOD Or Chairman I wonder if the two chairman could approach the White House within the next hour since they have this under consideration to encourage them to make this information public and to relay the will of I believe it s the will of the joint committee that based on what our staff director ha said that this information is important to be released And it sound like they re trying to make a political decision And we would the joint committee would encourage them to release the information I say that because it s under consideration and I think it s important particularly given the testimony that wa provided by the first two witness Thank you REP GOSS Thank you Or LaHood I assure you that this is not a matter of first impression for the two chairman or actually the four of u He have made this case before And just so all member of the committee and the public will know there are approximately generalized area that we feel there is legitimate to withhold information to the public Otherwise we feel the burden is on to the administration to prove to u why we should not give it to the public He take the position the public deserves it Those three exception are of course source and method particularly those still active plan and intention that would be involving any action we might take which might put our personnel at harm by giving advance information about what they re up to and the third area is in the active prosecution going by the Department of Justice He do n t want to in any way mess up a prosecution that is going forward by saying something inadvertent that would create a problem for the prosecution I think other than those three area the public ha a right to know and a need to know because part of the reason we re going public hear is the awareness curve of what this enemy look like what they can do to u and why we need to have a better system and why we are going to be asking for the support of our constituency the American people to give u a better intelligence system and all that that mean I hope that s a satisfactory answer And your request is duly noted and will be dealt with Would you please proceed after I advise the member that we have about minute left on a vote in the House Is it one vote or two To we know I believe it is one vote To member of the Senate wish to continue SEN FEINSTEIN Or Chairman Or Chairman REP GOSS Yes Senator SEN FEINSTEIN Right I ask a question Will there be a brief recess over the lunch hour for those of u that have commitment REP GOSS It had been intended that there would not be and I would suggest that when Senator Graham come back that you confer with him on that The member of the House are now going to vote and we will be away for about minute And perhaps in that time you can decide how you wish to carry forward SEN SHELBY Or Chairman do you want u to wait and suspend the hearing Because you wo n t have the benefit of her testimony REP GOSS That is the view of the member To you want them to suspend or SEN SHELBY Will you get back I think so SEN GRAHAM The hearing will suspend until the member of the House return Recess SEN GRAHAM All the hearing back to order Is Cleaner Will wa in the early stage of providing u with the report of the joint inquiry staff For purpose of people s schedule it is our plan after Is Will complete her statement to them call upon member in the order in which they arrived for five minute of either question or comment I recognize that we will be running through the lunch hour Of member have to leave for previous commitment or the pang of hunger become overwhelming they are encouraged to do so but also encouraged to return so that they can have their opportunity to ask question or make their comment Is Will of HILL Thank you Or Chairman SEN FEINSTEIN Excuse me Or Chairman could you read the list so we might know where we are SEN GRAHAM Yes ma am The after the the chair and vice chair they are in this order Senator define Congressmen Boehlert Senator Den Congressmen Bereuter Congressmen Bishop Senator Even Senator Inhofe Congressmen Peterson Congressmen Prayer Congressmen Boswell Congressmen Castle Congressmen Former Congresswoman Warman Congressmen Burr Senator May Senator Rockefeller Senator Feinstein Senator Nikolski Congressmen LaHood Congressmen Hoekstra Senator Edwards Congressmen Ribbons Congressmen Everett SEN INHOFE Or Chairman SEN GRAHAM Yes SEN INHOFE Would it be appropriate to ask unanimous consent of the member that if individual do have to leave if they have statement that they could be included a part of the record SEN GRAHAM It will be included in the record SEN INHOFE I thank the chair SEN GRAHAM Are there any other comment before we return to Is Will Is Will of HILL Thank you Or Chairman Before I forget I do want to ask that we have two version of this statement it s the same statement but we have two copy one of which ha been signed and terrified a releasable cleared for public release by the chair of the classification working group for the intelligence community and each page ha been initiated by that individual And the second copy that I would also like to make available and part of the record is a similar copy that wa signed and terrified by the representative of the Department of Justice and initiated indicating that they agreed and occurred that it wa suitable for public release because a you know the Justice Department ha some litigation concern going case To I d ask that those be made part of the record SEN GRAHAM Without objection of HILL Okay I appreciate the opportunity to appear here today to advise the committee and the American public on the progress to date of the joint inquiry staff s review of the activity of the U S intelligence community in connection with the September th terrorist attack on the United States Is the horror and sheer inhumanity of that day engulfed this nation all of u struggled with shock with the utter disbelieve and the inevitable search for answer The question if not the answer were obvious Now could we have been so surprised That did our government especially our intelligence agency know before September th Why did n t they know more That can we do to strengthen and improve the capability of our intelligence agency and a a result help save ourselves and our child from ever having to face this again In February th the leadership of these two committee announced their resolve to come together to find incredible answer to those covering but clinically important question The committee joined in an unprecedented bilateral and partisan joint inquiry effort to meet that challenge To conduct the review the committee assembled a single staff that we call the joint inquiry staff of highly skilled professional with experience in such area a intelligence collection analysis management law enforcement investigation and oversight By testimony this morning is intended to address the inquiry s initial task which wa to conduct a actual review of what the intelligence community knew or should have known prior to September th regarding the international terrorist threat to the United States I caution that the inquiry remains a work in progress and that we may be developing additional relevant information a our work continues That being said we feel it is important to share with the American people through these hearing what we have found through our effort to date Met me briefly describe the way in which we have approached this review He decided to target our search on category of information that would most likely yield any intelligence material of relevance to the September th attack Specifically our tear requested and reviewed from the intelligence community agency these category of information any information obtained before September th suggesting that an attack on the United States wa imminent and what wa done with it any information obtained before September th that should have averted the intelligence community to this kind of attack that is using airplane to attack building and what wa done with it any information obtained before September th about the dead hijacker and what wa done with it and any information obtained after September th about the hijacker and their background including their involvement with al Qaeda entry into this country and activity while in this country a well a why they never came to the attention of the United States government And I would point out on the issue of the hijacker that we do intend we will not address that this morning but we do intend to have an additional statement at subsequent hearing that are focused on that issue Is part of it review of the evolution of the international terrorist threat against the United States the joint inquiry staff produced a chronology that began in and end on September th and that chronology I believe ha been reproduced and handed out and is also depicted on these chart here in the room this morning And I would request that the chronology also be made part of the record SEN GRAHAM Without objection so ordered of HILL The chronology note significant event in international terrorist significant counter terrorist action that were taken by the U S government in response to the threat and information received by the intelligence community that wa potentially relevant to the September th attack The chronology underscore several point regarding with the U S government specifically the intelligence community knew about the international terrorist threat to the United States and U S interest prior to September th and these are those point September th while indelible in magnitude and in impact wa by no mean America s first confrontation with international terrorist While the nature of the threat ha evolved and changed over time it ha long been recognized that United States interest were considered prime target by various international terrorist group In response to a number of terrorist attack on U S interest abroad during the s the U S government initiated a focused effort on terrorist against terrorist including the establishment by the director of central intelligence William Cases of the Counter Terrorist Enter or CTC at CIA headquarters in In year later the FBI created it own counter terrorist center at FBI headquarters Both in term of attempt and actual attack there wa considerable historical evidence prior to September th that international terrorist had planned and were in fact capable of conducting major terrorist strike within the United States The attack on the World Trade Enter the subsequent discovery in of plot to bomb New Work City landmark and the arrest in during the millennium of an individual with al Qaeda connection intending to bomb Os Angeles International Airport should have erased any doubt to the extent they existed about that point From through a late a August the intelligence community had received information indicating that international terrorist had seriously considered the use of airplane a a mean of carrying out terrorist attack While this method of attack had clearly been discussed in terrorist circle there wa apparently little if any effort by intelligence community analysis to produce any strategic assessment of terrorist using aircraft a weapon Same In Laden s role in international terrorist came to the attention of the intelligence community in the early s While bin Laden wa initially viewed a a financier of terrorist by the intelligence community wa aware of his involvement in directing terrorist act and had begun actively collecting intelligence on him In Laden s own word indicated a steadily excavating threat In August Same In Laden issued a public fatal or religious decree authorizing attack on Western military target in the Arabian Peninsula In February bin Laden issued another public fatal authorizing and promoting attack on U S civilian and military personnel anywhere in the world Following the August coming of two U S embassy in Last Africa intelligence community leadership recognized how dangerous bin Laden s network wa In December director of central intelligence George Genet provided written guidance to his deputy at the CIA declaring in effect a quote war with bin Laden While counter terrorist wa a resource priority from the time of the DCI s statement onward it wa competing with several other intelligence priority such a non proliferation Despite the DCI s declaration of war in there wa no massive shift in budget or assignment of personnel to counter terrorist until after September th By late the intelligence community had passed a growing body of information though general in nature and lacking specific detail on time and on place indicating that bin Laden and the al Qaeda network intended to strike within the United States and concern about bin Laden continued to grow over time and reached peak level in the spring and summer of a the intelligence community faced increasing number of report of imminent al Qaeda attack against U S interest In July and August that rise in intelligence reporting began to decrease just a three additional development occurred in the United States the Phoenix meme the detention of Zacarias Moussaoui and the intelligence community s realization that two individual with tie to bin Laden s network Valid Ll Midhar and Away Alhamzi were possibly in the United States The two individual turned out to be two of the hijacker on September th The intelligence community apparently had not connected these individual warning flag to each other to the drumbeat of threat reporting that had just occurred or to the urgency of the war effort against bin Laden Our review today provides further context for each of these point and my written statement address in great detail each point For purpose of this review I am going to focus not on the historical section but rather on our review of more recent intelligence reporting And the first point in that regard would be intelligence reporting on bin Laden s intention to strike inside the United States Central to the September th plot wa Same In Laden s idea of carrying out a terrorist operation within the United States It ha been suggested that prior to September th information available to the intelligence community had for the most part pointed to a terrorist threat against U S interest abroad Our review confirmed that shortly after Same In Laden s May press conference the intelligence community began to acquire intelligence information indicating that bin Laden s network intended to strike within the United States These intelligence report which I ll go through in a minute should be understood in their proper context First they generally did not contain specific information a to where when and how a terrorist attack might occur and generally they are not corroborate by further information Second these report represented a small percentage of the threat information that the intelligence community obtained during this period most of which pointed to the possibility of attack against U S interest overseas Nonetheless there wa a modest but relatively steady stream of intelligence information indicating the possibility of terrorist attack within the United States Third the credibility of the source providing this information wa sometimes questionable While one could not a a result give too much presence to some individual report the vitality of the information in the body of reporting clearly reiterated a consistent and clinically important theme bin Laden s intent to launch terrorist attack inside the United States And I will summarize several of these report and I should stress again these are in classified version they have been classified In June the intelligence community obtained information from several source that bin Laden wa considering attack in the United States including Washington D C and New Work His information wa provided to senior U S government official in July In August the intelligence community obtained information that a group of identified Grabs planned to fly an explosive laden plane from a foreign country into the World Trade Enter The information wa passed to the FBI and the FAA The FAA found the plot highly unlikely given the state of that foreign country s aviation program Moreover they believed that a flight originating outside the United States would be detected before it reached it intended target inside the United States The FBI s New Work office took no action on the information filing the communication in the office s coming depositor file The intelligence community ha acquired additional information since then indicating there may be link between this group and other terrorist group including al Qaeda In September the intelligence community prepared a memorandum detailing al Qaeda infrastructure in the United States including the use of front for terrorist activity His information wa provided to senior U S government official in September of In September of the intelligence community obtained information that bin Laden s next operation would possibly involve flying an aircraft loaded with explosive into a U S airport and decorating it His information wa provided to senior U S government official in late In October the intelligence community obtained information that al Qaeda wa trying to establish and operative cell within the United States His information indicated there might be an effort underway to recruit U S citizen Islamists and U S based expatriate from the Middle Last and North Africa In the fall of the intelligence community received information concerning a bin Laden plot involving aircraft in the New Work and Washington D C area In November the intelligence community obtained information that a bin Laden terrorist cell wa attempting to recruit a group of five to seven young men from the United States to travel to the Middle Last for training His wa in conjunction with planning to strike U S domestic target In November of the intelligence community received information that bin Laden and senior associate had agreed to allocate reward money for the assassination of four top intelligence agency officer The bounty for each assassination wa million The bounty wa in response to the U S announcement of an increase in the reward money for information leading to the arrest of bin Laden In the spring of the intelligence community obtained information about a planned bin Laden attack on a U S government facility in Washington D C In August the intelligence community obtained information that bin Laden s organization had decided to target the Secretary of State the Secretary of Defense and the Director of Central Intelligence Target wa interpreted by intelligence community analysis to mean assassinated In September the intelligence community obtained information that bin Laden and others were planning a terrorist act in the United States possibly against specific landmark in California and New Work City The reliability of the source of this information wa unknown In late the intelligence community obtained information regarding the bin Laden network s possible plan to attack target in Washington of and New Work City during the New Work s millennium celebration In December th an individual named Shed Essay wa arrested a he attempted to enter the United States from Canada In alert U S Customs Service officer in Sort Washington stopped Essay and asked to search his vehicle Chemicals and detonator material were found in his car Essay s intended target wa Os Angeles International Airport In February the intelligence community obtained information that bin Laden wa making plan to assassinated U S intelligence official including the director of the FBI In March the intelligence community obtained information regarding the type of target that operative in bin Laden s network might strike The Statue of Liberty wa specifically mentioned a were skyscraper port airport and nuclear power plant In March the intelligence community obtained information indicating bin Laden wa planning attack in specific West Coast area possibly involving the assassination of several public official The intelligence community had concern that this information might have come from a source known to abdicate information And in April the intelligence community obtained information from a source with terrorist connection who sacculated that bin Laden would be interested in commercial pilot a potential terrorist The source warned that the United States should not focus only on embassy coming that terrorist sought quote spectacular and traumatic closed quote attack and that the first World Trade Enter coming would be the type of attack that would be appealing The source did not mention a timeframe for any attack Because the source wa offering personal speculation and not hard information the information wa not disseminated within the intelligence community In Laden s declaration of war in and intelligence report indicating possible terrorist plot inside the United States did not go unnoticed by the intelligence community which in turn advised senior official in the U S government of the serious nature of the threat The staff ha also reviewed document other than individual intelligence report that demonstrate that at least at senior level the intelligence community understood that bin Laden posed a serious threat to the domestic United States Were are five example A December st intelligence community assessment of Same bin Laden read in part and I quote UBL is actively planning against U S target Multiple report indicate UBL is keenly interested in striking the U S on it own soil Ll Qaeda is recruiting operative for attack in the U S but ha not yet identified potential target In December th in a memorandum to his deputy at the CIA the director of Central Intelligence summed up the situation in this way quote He must now enter a new phase in our effort against bin Laden Our work to date ha been remarkable and in some instance heroic yet each day we all acknowledge that retaliation is inevitable and that it scope may be far larger than we have previously experienced He are at war I want no resource or people spared in this effort either inside CIA or the community A classified document signed by a senior U S government official in December read in part quote The intelligence community ha strong indication that bin Laden intends to conduct or sponsor attack inside the United States In June testimony before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and in a July bringing to House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence suffers the chief of the CTC described report that bin Laden and his associate were planning attack in the United States And a classified document signed by a senior U S government official in July characterized bin Laden s February statement a quote a de facto declaration of war close quote on the United States That is left clear is the extent to which other part of the government a well a the American people understood and fully appreciated the gravity and the immediate of the threat For example official at the National Security Agency whom we have interview were aware of DCI Genet s December declaration that the intelligence community wa at war with bin Laden In the other hand relatively few of the FBI agent interview by the Joint Inquiry Staff seem to have been aware of DCI Genet s declaration There wa also considerable variation in the degree to which FBI led Joint Terrorist Ask Forces or JTTF prioritized and coordinate field effort marketing bin Laden and al Qaeda While the FBI s New Work office wa the lead office in the vast majority of counter terrorist investigation concerning bin Laden many other FBI office around the country were unaware of the magnitude of the threat There are also indication that the allocation of intelligence community resource after the DCI s December declaration did not adequately reflect a true war effort against bin Laden In the CTC had only three analysis assigned full time to bin Laden s terrorist network worldwide After but before September th that number had risen to five In a broader scale our review ha found little evidence prior to September th of a sustained national effort to mobilized public awareness and to garden the holland against a potential assault by bin Laden within the United States with the possible exception of a heightened focus on weapon of mass destruction The second point that I want to cover is strategic warning indication of a possible terrorist attack in the spring and summer of Met me briefly describe what we have found regarding the level and the nature of threat information that wa obtained by the intelligence community during the spring and summer of During that time period the community experienced a significant rise in information indicating that bin Laden and al Qaeda intended to strike against United States interest in the very near future Some individual within the community have suggested that the increase in threat reporting wa unprecedented at least in term of their own experience While the reporting repeatedly predicted dire consequence for Americans it did not provide actionable detail on when where and how specific attack would occur Between late March and September the intelligence community detected numerous indicator of an impending terrorist attack some of which pointed specifically to the United States a a possible target In March an intelligence source claimed a group of bin Laden operative were planning to conduct an specified attack in the United States in April One of the operative allegedly resided within the United States In April the intelligence community obtained information that specified terrorist operative in California and New Work State were planning a terrorist attack in those state for April Between May and July the National Security Agency reported at least communication indicating a possible imminent terrorist attack One of these report provided any specific information on where when or how an attack might occur nor wa it clear that any of the individual involved in these intercepted communication had any firsthand knowledge of where when or how an attack might occur Of they did know it wa not evident in the intercept These report were widely disseminated within the intelligence community In May the intelligence community obtained information that supporter of bin Laden were reportedly planning to infiltrate the United States via Canada in order to carrot a terrorist operation using high explosive The report mentioned an attack within the United States though it did not say where in the U S or when or how an attack might occur In July this information wa shared with the FBI the Immigration and Naturalization Service the U S Customs Service and the State Department and wa included in a closely held intelligence report for senior government official in August In May the Department of Defense acquired and shared with other element of the intelligence community information indicating that seven individual associated with bin Laden had departed various location for Canada the United Kingdom and the United States In June the DCI s CTC had information that key operative in Same bin Laden s organization were disappearing while others were preparing for martyrdom In July the DCI s CTC wa aware of an individual who had recently been in Afghanistan who had reported quote everyone is talking about an impending attack close quote The intelligence community wa also aware that bin Laden had stepped up his propaganda effort in the preceding month In August th in Minneapolis Minnesota the INS detained Zacarias Moussaoui Prior to that date in August Or Moussaoui s conduct had aroused suspicion about why he wa learning to fly large commercial aircraft and had prompted the flight school he wa attending in Minneapolis to contact the local FBI office FBI agent believed that Moussaoui may have been intending to carry out a terrorist act In August rd the intelligence community requested that two individual Valid al Midhar and Away Alhazmi who had first come to the attention of the community in a possible associate of bin Laden s terrorist network be added to the U S Department of State s watch list for denying vista to individual attempting to enter the United States Working level of INS and U S Customs had determined that at least one of them wa likely in the United States prompting FBI headquarters to request search for them in both New Work and Os Angeles The FBI s New Work field office successfully searched for al Midhar and Alhazmi The FBI s Os Angeles office received the search request on September th In late summer the intelligence community obtained information that an individual associated with al Qaeda wa considering mounting terrorist operation within the United States There wa no information available a to the timing of possible attack or the alleged target And on September th the NSA intercepted two communication between individual abroad suggesting imminent terrorist activity These communication were not translated into English and disseminated until September th These intercept did not provide any indication of where or what activity might occur Despite these indicator of a possible terrorist attack inside the United States during the course of interview the joint inquiry staff wa told that it wa the general view of the U S intelligence community in the spring and summer of that an attack on U S interest wa more likely to occur overseas Individuals in the intelligence community pointed to intelligence information the arrest of suspected terrorist in the Middle Last and Europe and a incredible report of a plan to attack a U S Embassy in the Middle Last a factor that shaped their thinking about where an attack wa likely to occur One senior FBI official said that based on the intelligence he wa seeing he thought there wa a high probability quote percent close quote that the attack would occur overseas During the summer of the intelligence community wa also dissemination information through appropriate channel to senior U S government official about possible terrorist attack For example in June the community issued a terrorist threat advisory warning U S government agency that there wa a high probability of an imminent terrorist attack against U S interest by Funny extremist associated with bin Laden s al Qaeda organization The advisory mentioned the Arabian peninsula Israel and Italy a possible location According to the advisory the community continued to believe that Funny extremist associated with al Qaeda are most likely to attempt spectacular attack resulting in numerous casualty Subsequently intelligence information provided to senior government leader indicated that bin Laden s organization expected near term attack to have dramatic consequence on government or cause major casualty A bringing prepared for senior government official at the beginning of July contained the following language quote Based on a review of all source reporting over the last five month we believe that UBL will launch a significant terrorist attack against U S and or Israel interest in the coming week The attack will be spectacular and designed to inflict mass casualty against U S facility or interest Attack preparation have been made Attack will occur with little or no warning Later intelligence information provided to senior government leader indicated that bin Laden s organization continued to expect imminent attack on U S interest The joint inquiry staff ha been advised by a representative of the intelligence community that about a month later in August a closely held intelligence report for senior government official included information that bin Laden had wanted to conduct attack in the United States since The information included discussion of the arrest of Shed Essay in December and the coming of the U S embassy in Sonya and Tanzania It mentioned that member of al Qaeda including some U S citizen had resided or traveled in or traveled to the United States for year and that the group apparently maintained a support structure here The report cited uncorroborated information obtained in that bin Laden wanted to jack airplane to gain the release of U S held extremist FBI judgment about pattern of activity consistent with preparation of hijacking or other type of attack and the number of bin Laden number of investigation underway a well a information acquired in May that indicated a group of bin Laden s supporter wa planning attack in the United States with explosive In August based on information it had in it possession at the time the CIA sent a message to the FAA asking the FAA to advise corporate security director of U S air carrier of the following information Quote A group of six Pakistanis currently based in Bolivia may be planning to conduct a hacking or possibly a coming or an act of sabotage against at commercial airline While we have no detail of the carrier the date or the location of this or these possibly action we have learned the group ha had discussion in which Canada England Malaysia Cuba South Africa Mexico Atlanta New Work Madrid Moscow and Cuba have come up and India and Islamabad have been described a possible travel destination close quote While this information wa not related to an attack planned by al Qaeda it did alert the aviation community to the possibility that a hacking plot might occur in the U S shortly before the September th attack occurred Now I want to turn to intelligence information on possible terrorist use of airplane a weapon Central to the September th attack wa the terrorist use of airplane a weapon In the aftermath of the attack there wa much discussion about the extent to which our government wa or could have been aware of the threat of terrorist attack of this type and the extent to which adequate precaution were taken to address the threat Based on our review to date we believe that the intelligence community wa aware of the potential for this type of terrorist attack but did not produce any specific assessment of the likelihood that terrorist would use airplane a weapon Our review ha uncovered several example of intelligence reporting on the possible use of airplane a weapon in terrorist operation In December Algerian Armed Islamic Group terrorist hacked an Air France flight in Algiers and threatened to crash it into the Differ Power French authority deceived the terrorist into thinking the plane did not have enough fuel to reach Paris and diverted it A French anti terrorist force stormed the plane and killed all four terrorist In January a Philippine national police raid turned up material in a Manila apartment indicating that three individual planned among other thing to crash a plane into CIA headquarters The Philippine national police said that the same group wa responsible for the coming of a Philippine airline on December th Information on the threat wa passed to the FAA which briefer U S and major foreign carrier In January the intelligence community obtained information concerning a planned suicide attack by individual associated with Sheikh May Model Cabman and a key al Qaeda operative The plan wa to fly to the United States from Afghanistan and attack the White House In October the intelligence community obtained information regarding an Cranial plot to jack a Japanese plane over Israel and crash it into El Iv In individual would board the plane in the War Last During the flight he would commander the aircraft order it to fly over El Iv and then crash the plane into the city In one of the unit at FBI headquarters became concerned about the possibility of a terrorist group using an manned aerial vehicle UAV for terrorist attack The FBI and CIA became aware of reporting that this group had purchased a UAV It the time the agency s view wa that the only reason that this group would need a UAV would be for either reconnaissance or attack There wa more concern about the possibility of an attack outside the United States for example by flying the UAV into a U S Embassy or a visiting U S delegation Is noted previously in August the intelligence community obtained information that a group of identified Arab planned to fly an explosive laden plane from a foreign country into the World Trade Enter Also noted previously in September the intelligence community obtained information that bin Laden s next operation could possibly involve flying an aircraft loaded with explosive into a U S airport and decorating it In November the community obtained information that a Turkish Islamic extremist group had planned a suicide attack to coincide with celebration marking the death of Stature The conspirator who were arrested planned to crash an airplane packed with explosive into Stature s tomb during a government ceremony The Turkish press said the group had cooperated with Same bin Laden The FBI s New Work office included this incident in one of it Same bin Laden database In February the intelligence community obtained information that Ran had formed a suicide pilot unit it planned to use against British and U S force in the Persian Gulf The CIA commented that this wa highly unlikely and probably disinformation In March the intelligence community obtained information regarding a plan by an al Qaeda member who wa a U S citizen to fly a hang glided into the Egyptian presidential palace and then detonate the explosive he wa carrying The individual who received hang glided training in the United States brought the hang glided back to Afghanistan In April the intelligence community obtained information regarding an alleged bin Laden plot to jack a The source who wa a walk in to the FBI s Newark office claimed that he had been to a training camp in Pakistan where he learned hacking technique and received arm training He also stated that he wa supposed to meet five to six other individual in the United States who would also participate in the plot They were instructed to use all necessary force to take over the plane because there would be pilot among the hacking team The plan wa to fly the plane to Afghanistan and if they could not make it there that they were to blow up the plane Although the individual passed an FBI polygraph the FBI wa never able to verify any aspect of his story or identify his contact in the United States And in August the intelligence community obtained information regarding a plot to either bomb the U S Embassy in Nairobi from an airplane or crash an airplane into it The intelligence community learned that two people who were reportedly acting on instruction from bin Laden met in October to discus this plot Despite these report the community did not produce any specific assessment of the likelihood that terrorist would use airplane a weapon His may have been driven in part by resource issue in the area of intelligence analysis Prior to September th the CTC had analysis to analyze terrorist issue worldwide with only one of the five branch focused on terrorist tactic Prior to September th the only terrorist tactic on which the CTC performed strategic analysis wa the possible use of chemical biological radiological and nuclear weapon because there were more obvious potential for mass casualty It the FBI prior to September th support for going investigation and operation wa favored in term of resource over long term strategic analysis He were told during the course of our FBI interview that prevention occurred in the operational unit not through strategic analysis and that prior to September th the FBI had insufficient resource to do both He were also told that the FBI s al Qaeda related analysis expertise had been quote gutted close quote by transfer to operational unit and that a a result the FBI s analysis unit had only one individual working on al Qaeda at the time of the September attack While focused strategic analysis wa lacking the subject of aviation related terrorist wa included in some broader terrorist threat assessment such a the National Intelligence Estimate on Terrorist For example the NIE on terrorist cited the consideration the Bojinka conspirator gave to attacking CIA headquarters with an aircraft The document contained the following language Our review of the evidence suggests that the conspirator were guided in the selection of the method and venue of the attack by carefully studying security procedure in place in the region Of terrorist operating in this country the United States are similarly methodical they will identify serious vulnerability in the security system for domestic flight The update to that report on terrorist included the following language Civil aviation remains a particularly attractive target in light of the fear and publicity the owning of an airline would evoke and the revelation last summer of the U S air transport sector s vulnerability In a December report the FBI and the FAA published a classified assessment that suggested le concern about the threat to domestic aviation Quote FBI investigation confirm domestic and international terrorist group operating within the United States but do not suggest evidence of plan to target domestic civil aviation Terrorist activity within the U S ha focused primarily on fundraising recruiting new member and dissemination propaganda While international terrorist have conducted attack on U S soil these act represent anomaly in their traditional marketing which focused on U S interest overseas After September th the CIA belated acknowledged some of the information that wa available and ha been available regarding the use of airplane a weapon A draft analysis dated November th entitled The September th Attack A Preliminary Assessment state He do not know the process by which bin Laden and his lieutenant decided to jack plane with the idea of flying them into building in the United States But the idea of hacking plane for suicide attack had long been current in jihadist circle For example GIA terrorist from Algeria had planned to crash an Air France jet into the Differ Power in December And Ami House a participant in the World Trade Enter coming planned to explode U S jet milliner retainer in impair over the Pacific in the mid s Likewise the World Trade Enter had long been a target of terrorist comber Despite the intelligence available in recent year our review to date ha found no indication that prior to September th analysis from the intelligence community were cataloguing information regarding the use of airplane a weapon a a terrorist tactic sending requirement to collector to look for additional information on this threat or considering the likelihood that Same bin Laden al Qaeda or any other terrorist group would attack the United States or U S interest in these way in this way Or Chairman our purpose this morning wa to report on the information that the intelligence community possessed prior to September th about terrorist attack of the kind America witnessed on that fateful day In closing let me just say that for all of u who have been conducting this review the task ha been and continues to be not only a dancing one but in all respect a covering one He are ever mindful that lost life and shattered family were the cataclysm for this inquiry He know a I have heard Is Pelosi say many time that we are on sacred ground He also have come to know from our review of the intelligence reporting the depth and the intensity of the enemy s hatred for this country and the relentless zeal with which it target American life He understand not only the importance but also the deformity of the task facing the intelligence community Is my statement this morning suggests the community made mistake prior to September th and the problem that led to those mistake need to be addressed and they need to be fixed In the other hand the vengeance and the inhumanity that we saw on that day were not mistake for Same bin Laden and for others like him The responsibility for September th remains squarely on the shoulder of the terrorist who planned and participated in the attack Their fervor and their cruelty may be incomprehensible but it is real It persists and it is directed at Americans He are convinced that it is no longer a question of whether the intelligence community can do better It must do better America can afford no le Or Chairman that concluded my statement this morning Thank you SEN GRAHAM Is Will I would like to extend my congratulation to you and the staff for an excellent covering assessment of the event prior to September the th I recognize this is the first of what will be a series of publicly released statement of the result of our inquiry to date and we look forward to your future report of HILL Thank you Or Chairman SEN GRAHAM He will now proceed to question and comment from member starting with Senator define Met me just state who the next question will be Or Boehlert Senator Den Or Bereuter Or Bishop Senator Even Senator Inhofe Or Peterson Or Prayer SEN MIKE DEWINE R of Or Chairman thank you very much Is Will thank you for your very good statement and your good work of HILL Thank you Senator SEN DEWINE Or Chairman thank you for the opportunity to make some brief remark at this very important public hearing Met me also thank our witness who testified this morning While none of u can really understand what we ve been through I have seen how tragic the event of September th have been for my own state director a very good friend of mine Barbara Kent s Barbara lost her husband You Cherry s to the terrorist attack Before talking about what I hope come out of these hearing let me express a concern I ve been concerned from the outset of this investigation that the timed deadline under which this committee is operating would not be conducing to producing the product that we want The artificial deadline I believe is making it extremely difficult to get the job done It s simply a lack of time It s a lack of resource However Or Chairman there still are thing that we can accomplish even with the current constraint of this investigation First it is important to report and we ve begun this today it s important to report to the American people what intelligence failure did occur not so we can ass blame but so we can learn from the specific mistake that were made But there is more to it than that Yes we need to gather the fact and take time to examine what they mean with regard to what happened on September th But we certainly can not stop there He also need to figure out what these fact tell u about the current structure of our overall intelligence community That are the shortcoming There do we need reform Now I felt Or Rush s testimony earlier wa very excellent I thought he talked about some of the big picture issue that we re not going to resolve on this committee but at least we can begin to look at and begin that national dialogue about these issue To I thought his testimony wa particularly telling I think for example Or Chairman in investigation these issue we must take a serious look at the role of the director of Central Intelligence I believe it s time to give the DCI the necessary authority and ability to truly direct our overall intelligence operation Quite simply we need to empower the DCI to do the job I believe we also must seriously examine the long term resource issue that confront u not just now but over the long haul over the next decade or two decade To we have the human resource available within the agency themselves To we have the right technology and enough of it to get the job done in the new world that we live in To we have a long term commitment to intelligence I think we need to discus that commitment and what we are looking at and make it very plain to the American people the sacrifice that are going to have to be made if that intelligence community is to do it job and what kind of resource they need And finally I believe that we need to re examine the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act with the FISA statute and determine what change are needed to make sure we are getting the intelligence resource to help prevent future attack FISA deserves and requires a great deal of attention and oversight from the joint committee from the Senate and House Intelligence Committees and frankly from the entire Congress He must focus our congressional duty for oversight a we simply have not had in my opinion effective oversight since FISA wa instituted approximately a quarter of a century ago Somehow we ve got to figure out Or Chairman how to do that Finally this committee s job I believe is really to kick off to launch a serious national debate about what change must be made in our intelligence community because if we ve learned anything from September th it is that our security our safety the safety of our loved one is intrinsically linked to the quality of that intelligence I thank the chair SEN GRAHAM Thank you Senator Congressmen Boehlert REP SHERWOOD BOEHLERT R of Or Chairman let me ask a procedure Are we just to have an opening statement or to go right to question SEN GRAHAM It is your choice You have five minute for either question or discussion REP BOEHLERT I thank you very much Or Chairman Is Will let me thank you for an excellent presentation Met me begin where you ended You said He are convinced that it is no longer a question of whether the intelligence community can do better It must do better America can afford no le I could not agree more with that statement Your summation of our closed hearing and the revelation of information in the public domain is somewhat difficult to deal with because so much of what we ve had obviously during those closed hearing ha been highly classified dealing with sensitive national security information But it appears to me that the alarm wa sounded not once but several time but too many gave it a deaf ear I m not ascribing any sinister motif I m just saying too many were not paying attention There are a lot of reason for that resource deficiency lack of adequate staff Some of the revelation in your testimony are just absolutely mind begging But let me ask something Back in when the director of Central Intelligence declared war on al Qaeda sent a memorandum to his agency people Was it a unilateral declaration of war Was that memorandum shared with anyone but the in house people at CIA Did it go to the FBI Did it go to all the other agency in the intelligence community of HILL He have been following that question in the course of our interview and we ve been basically we re dealing with a lot of the agency in the intelligence community He re trying to find out how much the entire community wa aware of that declaration of war And what we re finding is some people were I think close certainly senior level in the CIA were and probably in the CIA But a I mentioned if you go out to the field office of the FBI they were not aware of it Other people in the federal government were not aware of it The Defense Department people we ve interview some people there who were not aware of it who might have been interlacing with the community To I would say it appears to be it wa the DCI s decision It wa circulated to some people but certainly not broadly within the community And what I find disturbing about it is that it wa at senior level but sometimes the operative level the level in the field is where it actually is critical that they know what the priority should be and have to be particularly when it s something like combating something like al Qaeda The field office of the FBI in term of domestic activity are crucial because they are the one who are going to be in the front line in the United States dealing with those kind of group And at least in that respect what we re finding is that many of them were not aware of that declaration of war and some of them really were not focused very much at all on al Qaeda and bin Laden REP BOEHLERT Well I find that incomprehensible quite frankly because a key operative in our intelligence community a leader issued something a important a a declaration of war against an organization that ha openly declared it determined effort the fatal the religious decree to destroy America and Americans And that information is not shared at the highest level down to the lowest level which brings me forward to the Phoenix meme and the Minneapolis case involving Or Moussaoui And I ve checked with counsel to see if it s all right to reveal some of this stuff because the problem is I have difficulty and I ve had it for all the year I ve served on the committee in recalling where I learned the information I have Was it from a highly secure highly sensitive bringing or did I read it in the front page of the newspaper And so my practice ha been to just not talk to the medium at all about this very important assignment When we go forward to the Phoenix meme which wa sent up to headquarters at a time we had a declaration of war in the intelligence community and the meme wa marked routine of HILL Well and it wa not only at the time of the declaration of war it wa in the summer of It wa at a time when the threat level wa very high also REP BOEHLERT And so the meme wa marked routine and it wa given the most routine handling and never got above mid level And then we go out to Minneapolis and the Moussaoui case and that wa treated in a somewhat cavalier very routine manner I fail to see how with all the alarm that were sounded well we know there wa not the proper coordination There wa not the proper information sharing You have indicated some corrective action ha been taken oh my God we d only hope so since September th But I would suggest a lot of corrective action should have been taken well before September th Met me ask you this With our first two witness Is Breitweiser and Or Rush and their testimony wa very poignant SEN GRAHAM Your time ha expired REP BOEHLERT That s a fast five minute Must let me finish the one question I m in the middle of it SEN GRAHAM He ll be compassionate REP BOEHLERT Did you spend an extended amount of time with both of these witness Because they both have statement that are forever seared in our soul Some deal with opinion Others deal with alleged fact And so did you spend a good amount of time with them And have you checked up on the alleged fact that they presented And I m not questioning those fact I just want to make sure we re dealing with the same information of HILL I have met with Is Breitweiser several time since I joined this effort with the committee with her and her group And Or Rush I believe I ve met with him once I have not checked up on all the specific in their statement because I did n t see their statement till we got those statement yesterday But I ve had a lot of discussion with them And some of the thing you know that they mentioned I m aware of Some of them I d want to look into in more detail obviously REP BOEHLERT Thank you very much Thank you Or Chairman for your indulgence SEN GRAHAM Thank you Senator Den SEN RON WYDEN R of Thank you Or Chairman Is Will a you know there were year of history indicating that airplane would be used a a tool of terrorist And yet you state on page and I ll quote here Our review to date ha found no indication that prior to September th analysis in the intelligence community were cataloguing information regarding the use of airplane a weapon a a terrorist tactic sending requirement to collector to look for additional information on this threat or considering the likelihood that bin Laden al Qaeda or other terrorist group would attack the United States or U S interest in this way That is a remarkable statement given the history going back I believe to at least And my question to begin with is when you ask the intelligence community why this wa the case why they did n t catalogue this information regarding the use of plane a weapon or consider the likelihood that they would be used a terrorist tool what wa the response of the intelligence community when you asked them why of HILL Well I think a couple thing They would probably say to that question and we ve spoken to many people over there and gotten opinion and reaction on this you have to understand the reason we have been able to catalogue all these instance is because one of the thing we did wa ask the community to go back and find anything that related to aircraft a weapon To we went back and consolidated and went through their database to pull it all out so you could see it all together And I do n t believe that had been done before we focused on it given September th To one it s not been all pulled together for them to see it other than piecemeal over time Secondly I think what they will tell you on almost many of these thing in the terrorist field is that they were overwhelmed The people who were looking at al Qaeda and bin Laden will complain to you about resource about the amount of information that wa coming in They were overwhelmed by almost a flood of information Because a you can see from our statement there s a lot of reporting in there just on these topic And of course that reporting is but a small amount of the overall amount of reporting that the community deal with To I think the reason they would give you that they had not done that wa that it wa spread out over time they were overwhelmed by resource and other priority and they were overwhelmed by the amount of information they were getting and dealing with the response to other area SEN WYDEN That is so hard to swallow however is how anything could be a higher priority than this And for you to state that the intelligence community wa not considering the likelihood that bin Laden al Qaeda would attack the United States in this way is of course exactly the kind of thing we ve got to address in this inquiry In your testimony and also from the victim family we have heard about the failure to place Valid al Midhar and Away Alhazmi and by the way Or Alhazmi is listed in the phone book in An Diego I gather of HILL I m aware of that SEN WYDEN on a watch list that would have prevented their entry into the United States I offered an amendment on the intelligence bill this year to create a terrorist cracking system that would help ensure that this information would finally actually get shared to everybody in the intelligence area everybody in the law enforcement area and would actually get to local law enforcement official In your view to make this kind of system effective what sort of policy need to be included so that finally we can respond to what Or Rush ha asked for and that is to have a system that on an going basis make this a top priority cracking the most dangerous individual who threaten this country of HILL Well I think part of it is you have to get people s attention I mean you have to get people focused on the need to do that people in the system in the agency and in the group that are working on those issue I mean in this case and we re going to go into that particular case in much more detail when we present our testimony or our statement on the hijacker that would relate to the case you re talking about so we will go into it in a lot more detail and tell you what we ve heard from people who were handling that information at the time and why it slipped by them But I think part of what you will hear again wa you may hear thing everything from they had too many thing to do it wa n t considered that significant they were overwhelmed and it wa simply a mistake they made a mistake SEN WYDEN Or Chairman my time ha expired I would only want to add one last point with respect to where I think we are in term of our inquiry Is we all know there are many both on this committee and off who think that essentially this committee ought to punt to an independent effort I m of the view that the bar is very very high now in term of establishing the credibility of this effort and to show that we re capable of attacking these fundamental problem His is not something that s going to be solved by just moving the box around on the organizational chart and people going up with printer and saying the problem is solved To I think Is Will ha helped u with the family to get off to a good start and I look forward to working with my colleague SEN GRAHAM Thank you very much Senator Or Bishop REP BISHOP Thank you His is indeed an historic occasion when the two intelligence committee are working together on a matter of great importance like this come to pas And I m sure however that given the nature and the circumstance which require our attention the destructive attack on our country September th it s a task which all of u wish that we did n t have to face But we re most appreciative today for the well prepared thoughtful and helpful testimony presented by Is Breitweiser and Or Rush He have a responsibility to thoroughly and professionally gather ass and present the fact about September th a they relate to the performance of the intelligence agency And a we enter these public hearing there remains a general sense of disappointment and disbelieve within the American people that those agency particularly the CIA and the FBI were not better position to detect the conspiracy and to prevent the attack He must try to address the many question which have arisen about why better intelligence wa not collected why better use wa not made of the information which wa available and now publicly examining the performance of the community and the decision that were made in the Executive Branch and perhaps in Congress about the establishment of priority within the intelligence community He will be conducting the type of oversight which these committee are at present unique situated to provide It is my continued hope that these hearing and our final report will result in a marked improvement in our understanding of the event that led up to and most importantly in our ability to protect the American people from terrorist attack such a these I look forward to working with the joint leadership and all of our schedule witness and I want to thank Is Will and her staff for the tremendous work that they have done under very very difficult circumstance with some puzzling and bridging and limitation and with great time constraint It ha I think been a valiant effort and we will certainly a a committee work with you to try to secure the cooperation that you need from the Executive Branch and the agency in getting access and being able to explain to the American people and have this committee explain to the American people in the kind of detail which doe not compromise force and method plan and intention or active or going prosecution so that they can understand a well a we hope to understand what happened why it happened and what we can do to make sure it doe not happen again With that I have no question but I did want to share those comment and thank again the witness for taking the time and the effort which must have been extremely difficult given the exigency of your life over the past year to have come forward and done the magnificent job that you did today SEN GRAHAM Thank you Or Bishop Our next questioned or discussing will be Senator Even After Senator Even Or Boswell Or Castle Or Former Is Warman Or Burr Senator May and Senator Rockefeller Senator Even SEN LEVIN Thank you Or Chairman and first let me thank you Is Will and your staff for getting u to the point where we are finally analyzing and presenting to the American people the significant intelligence failure which occurred prior to September th It this stage of the inquiry much is already evident First the intelligence community said that it wa at war with Same bin Laden and had said so for three year prior to the attack of September th Second despite National Security Adviser Condaleeza Vice s assertion to the contrary the use of a plane a a terrorist weapon capable of causing mass casualty wa neither ingenious nor novel but rather a method of attack that the intelligence community knew that the terrorist were considering a early a the early to mid s Third there is much troubling evidence that information crucial to preventing attack by al Qaeda terrorist wa not shared or acted upon by intelligence official prior to September th Those intelligence failure will haunt loved one and their family and should also haunt u and motivate u to very strong and necessary reform Were are just a few example that I m summarizing from your report In January of the U S intelligence community wa averted to a meeting of al Qaeda member in Malaysia including two of the eventual hijacker of America Airline Light The handoff of that information from the CIA to the FBI wa burgled The individual were not traced and inexplicable were not promptly placed on a watch list Men day later the two accomplice entered the United States on a flight to Os Angeles The location of the individual after they were finally placed on the watch list wa also mishandled Second a July memorandum from an FBI field agent in Phoenix to the Same bin Laden unit and the radical fundamental unit at FBI headquarters requesting that an investigation be opened into foreign terrorist training at flight school in the U S wa never acted upon nor wa the Phoenix field investigation shared with the CIA a specifically suggested by the FBI agent And this is not in your meme but this is what we learned that nearly a year after the Phoenix meme the FBI director wa unable to explain to our committee who saw that request from the Phoenix FBI agent what wa done with the request and who if anyone had been held accountable for letting that important information fall between some crack Third the August th arrest of Zacarias Moussaoui and the suspicion of the FBI agent in Minneapolis that he might be planning to undertake a terrorist attack using a plane and the urgent request that a warrant to search his computer and other belonging were not acted upon by FBI headquarters And I want to emphasize a point here These were not some report from reliable source These were not unconfirmed statement These were FBI agent that were asking for action Their request were ignored Now I believe it is clinically important for the administration to release the Phoenix memorandum document relating to the Minneapolis FBI office request and other document that will allow the American people to judge for themselves the significance of these missed signal and the failure to share information between and within the intelligence and law enforcement community The committee I understand ha asked for classification of those document That request is under consideration I understand by the administration in preparation for next week s hearing And I we ve had discussion about this already this morning but I do hope that the leadership of these committee our committee will let the administration know that our committee will seek congressional authorization by legislation if necessary to classify appropriate information if the executive branch refuse He have chairman and vice chairman of our committee who have agreed on some matter It seems to me that is enough for u a committee to automatically authorize them to seek legislation should the executive branch refuse And that would go to future refusal not just to previous one The American people understand that perfection is unattainable but they also believe a I do that when error are made accountability accountability is essential if lesson are to be learned for the sake of the future security of our nation Now is my time up SEN GRAHAM Thank you Senator for those very thoughtful applause and obviously well received suggestion of action by the committee He will take those under advisement Or Boswell REP LEONARD BOSWELL D of Thank you Or Chairman I think the word that s hit me hardest today ha been the word covering And a I heard the testimony of Written and Stephen it caused me to have a little flashback in my earlier life when I had to spend a lonely night a some of the rest of you have done to write to the loved one where their loved one wa lost in the battlefield that day I ve sense your pain I love you respect you and want you to have relief And I see the relief for you is to see that these lesson learned are learned and followed and not have to be learned again I used to work for Admiral Lecky s the probably the most decorated living American you put that in your lesson learned file and do n t have to learn it again and that s what I hope we accomplish here I feel like that maybe my colleague from the Senate that said that maybe we do n t need this extra blue ribbon panel after listening to Written and Stephen I think he made a pretty good case maybe we do need it And I wonder about the time and the resource and availability to u to finish this job Well I trust that in the day lying ahead of you Or Chairman you re going to be dealing with this side of the operation and I know you ll give it serious consideration A couple of question Is Will that I might ask and I ll just ask them all and then I can refresh if you need them but I assume if do you intend to have further statement of fact a we go forward from here today of HILL Not today but we do in the future hearing right REP BOSWELL I mean in the future all right Would you want to elaborate a little bit on what or could you what agency had responsibility to respond to the warning He ve heard so much about the warning for two three year Would you have any comment from your research and your study that who should have been responding Military Who of HILL Well it would depend on what you mean a warning from the intelligence community or the report I mean REP BOSWELL Or a combination did we fail a part of our lesson learned if we can an area of maybe there should have been some response going out to somebody else of HILL Well some of the I mean some of this information wa disseminated further some wa not disseminated Some for instance we talked about some went to the FAA in certain case and then they in turn would put out a warning For instance I talked about the one of terrorist attack to commercial private industry REP BOSWELL Okay of HILL To it depends on the nature of what the threat wa and who they would warn But REP BOSWELL I think in your further analysis that may be what I m asking is that you share with u a you look at it and have more time if there are some thing that we could put in this of HILL He are I can say that we are pursuing the whole issue of I mean there s question warning and dissemination of information is not just sharing information a Senator Even wa talking about within the intelligence community between the FBI and CIA for example but also sharing threat information beyond the intelligence community to the agency within government outside the community and also to the private sector which get into the warning and how far this information went And that is an area we re looking at and we have n t yet you know come back with a report on it but we are looking at that And and you know that s a valid point because the intelligence not only is the job to get the good intelligence and to analyze it but then to disseminate it to people who can use it in a timely manner To REP BOSWELL Okay thank you And I just I ve got a little bit of time left do you have any comment about the you know all the emphasis on bin Laden and his activity and his lack of prior to September th that is lack of ability to to bring damage to u did that lure people into complacency even at the senior level of HILL I think part of it is a I alluded to earlier is that the community you know doe get so much information and a I said in this statement there were a lot of these threat coming in but they a lot of them they could n t really corroborate They did n t know if some of them were true or not true To I think you know it may be human nature if you keep hearing this stuff all the time and nothing happens and you never really know if it s accurate you tend to start disregarding And the the problem is that buried in the middle of all that where some may be accurate some may be not there may be something that really is important that need to be looked at To it may be that when the threat level wa very high and all the chatter wa coming through it wa hard to distinguish what wa really legitimate and something they needed to be concerned about REP BOSWELL Thank you very much By time is up I appreciate the hard work that you ve presented to u the straightforwardness and I m looking forward to what you further have to say a we go on from here of HILL Thank you SEN GRAHAM Thank you Or Boswell Or Castle REP MICHAEL CASTLE R of Thank you Or Chairman I would also like to thank Is Breitweiser and Or Rush for their testimony on their own behalf and on behalf of the others who have endured this You re brave to be here but you also had a lot to say and from a perspective that s different than we ve heard so far And I also thank Is Will for making sure that we started off with this testimony I think it s vitally important now that we hear this And some of my these are sort of statements slash questions let me go through a few of them and if we have time perhaps you could respond to some of them Is Will based in large part on matter that both Written and Stephen reference But what ha concerned me for some time and Or Boehlert reference it too and that is the whole business of of public verse private or classified information verse non classified information I for one have felt for some time having served on this committee for a while now that we over classify terribly in the world of intelligence You read about it the next day in the New Work Times it s about percent of what you had heard about the day before And I just have serious question about that But the point wa made in some of their testimony about the failure to warn the public and I would imagine the public really did n t know much about bin Laden Based on what you said I m not even sure the intelligence community knew what it should have known about bin Laden when September th came in He saw what the president ha been able to do with Madam Russen who is probably on the forefront of the mind of almost every American today He know what can be done if there is a greater public awareness of what is going on And a lot that s happened since September th of last year ha caused u all to be much more aware of possible terrorist activity or whatever I would hope a our committee look at all this we d look at the public aspect of it The American public is very intelligent and very cognizant of what s going on in the world and if they re given a chance to know what the potential problem are my sense is that perhaps we can prevent some of the problem that we ve had so far and we should n t be so closed a far a intelligence is concerned Now I understand there are circumstance in which that can not happen I well understand that and I m not trying to go too far in saying that but I really think we need to visit that question in term of speech being given by people in the intelligence community perhaps could be more open in term of information that could be released that kind of thing And I m very interested in pursuing that at some point Something that Or Rush said I had heard earlier when I had visited the holland security and that is that the official here in Washington were struck by how much the local law enforcement officer know about what s happening in their community about individual in their community perhaps troubled individual in their community various thing that we probably would never know in Washington D C There are a whole lot of them you know well over half a million state and local law enforcement officer who have a tremendous world of knowledge And I think that holland security is looking at trying to develop and to cultivate that knowledge and to make it part of a central not a central bank necessarily but the ability to have that information go up and be digested and used in dealing with terrorist and other activity in this country I think that s vitally important He do n t hear much about that He hear about the CIA and the FBI and NSA and various major federal agency When you re dealing overseas that s probably what it s all about But when you re dealing in America and also even when you are dealing overseas you are dealing with some sort of a cell or a god or somebody who is here locally It is very helpful to have that information And I hope a we go about our business of this particular committee and what we are doing that we incorporate that into it a well To that also concern me And there s another area that is much broader too than anything we have talked about and that s the area of prevention overall I am vitally concerned about the hatred that exist in the Middle Last apparently at least in certain pocket of the Middle Last for America and perhaps for Israel and other portion of the world And I do n t know how to go about this I am not suggesting that we should be starting to formulate policy with respect to diplomacy and education but it seems to me it is something we should be paying attention to Of we could get to the root cause of this of why that is there if we could start to build the relationship that might change this might take or year but I do n t think we should ignore it And perhaps it s a little bit beyond what we are doing on this committee But the bottom line is I think it s a very important function of what we are doing a American citizen to try to prevent terrorist activity a far a the future is concerned And I do have a specific question I d like you to comment on any of those thing and then a specific question and I think about second here I think and that is just how far along are we in term of all of your work Are we going to be able to get our work done by the completion of this Congress of HILL I am optimistic that we will be able to get through what we have in our mind sat down and figured would be our schedule in term of treating various topic that we think need to be treated There no one can ever be sure is that thing are still coming up a we investigate You know once you start looking at an agency and you are going through file what tends to happen is the more you get into it the more you start finding more thing And a we find thing we want to follow those where the fact lead and make sure we understand what did or did not happen And that take time To there are some thing like that that we are now working on that are going to take u more time because we have n t planned for that But I am cautiously optimistic we can make what I think would be a significant contribution on this whole front in term of really understanding what did and did n t happen here before the th and why we did n t know more in term of what were the system problem that were preventing people from knowing more To I ca n t I would be foolish to sit here and tell you we are going to look at every single document on terrorist that the United States government had for the last year because we have n t tried to do that He ve tried to narrow it to where we get to the relevant material that certains to September th And that I think we have a good shot at doing REP CASTLE Thank you Is Will I ll take my other statement and perhaps we can discus them further at some point I yield back Or Chairman SEN GRAHAM Thank you Or Castle Senator Rockefeller SEN ROCKEFELLER Thank you Or Chairman Thank you Is Will very much for your distinguished work In the interest of time Or Chairman I would like to make just three point First the fundamental question is what did the intelligence community know and then what did they do with what they knew The work of the committee ha not to this point unearthed any single piece of information or smoking gun if you will that would have in and of itself prevented the attack But we have found far too many breakdown in the intelligence gathering and processing method By own conclusion is that given the event and signal of the preceding decade the intelligence community could have and in my judgment should have anticipated an attack on U S soil on the scale of He had witnessed attack on Americans overseas a you laid out U S S Sole Sonya Tanzania Hoar attack on the World Trade Enter He knew beyond any doubt that al Qaeda wanted to strike the United States He were just sort of struck in our classic American innocence that anything that is going to happen is going to happen overseas But there wa information and plenty of it disseminated or not disseminated that something wa going to happen here Met the intelligence community for a whole host of reason did not launch the all out effort that is it responsibility that might have detected and potentially prevented Second the FBI is an outstanding law enforcement agency but I have serious question about whether it is the right place to do intelligence work necessary in our country Saw enforcement is not necessarily compatible with intelligence gathering in fact it is not It is not the same skill not the same mission Going forward we must not undermine the FBI s ability to carry out it fundamental responsibility because they are very important and they do it very well And we must not give short shift to new intelligence demand To we have to ask ourselves An the problem be addressed by reforming the FBI I do n t think so Or is this a case where we need to find a wholly different solution His is a tough question obviously which I hope this committee will be tickling in the coming month and it lead me to my final point Are we ready a a committee a a Congress a a government a a people not only to pose the tough question it s easy to do but also to find and to implement the tough solution It is clear to all of u that we must make serious change in how we gather process and react to intelligence in this country Our existing agency came into being in the Old War that s fine That structure no longer match the threat that we face Lines of authority are in my judgment blurred intentionally for the sake of turf for the sake of all kind of thing which in some case have justification and in many case do not The whole process leading up to today ha been an interesting example of how difficult it is to get you know at a very common purpose to get people to agree on some relatively simple thing To line of authority are blurred information get lost and the mission is focused The intelligence mission is focused It might best be described a trying to do everything and in the process doing little well War reaching change is n t just a goal it s a necessity Unfortunately it s a very controversial and very uncomfortable necessity It s something they do n t want to do here in Congress they do n t want to do at the White House they do n t want to do at the Defense Department they do n t want to do in the non defense intelligence aspect of what we carry on in this country But are we going to find the political will to create an intelligence system that work Or are we going to say that this is going to be politically practical or probably not double and therefore cut our goal by percent and then get beverage down from there To are we a a committee in which we have our own difference and our own conflict a a Congress where the same exists and a a government where the same exists and in the intelligence community where the same exists do we have the political will and the strength and the determination to do the job right Nothing else count Thank you SEN GRAHAM Thank you senator Or Former REP ROEMER Thank you Or Chairman I want to thank Is Will for an excellent presentation and outline this afternoon to help u understand this issue a bit more after several month of this investigation I want to compliment your top notch staff for their sacrifice and their hour of service to the country And Or Chairman you and Or Loss on my side I want to compliment both of you for bringing together in a partisan way this committee to launch an unprecedented bilateral investigation into the worst terrorist attack in our nation s history And it is with pride and confidence that I know we will produce a good product on this committee In listening to the very moving testimony from Written and Steve this morning I am even more convinced I am even more compelled to work hard I am even more persuaded that an independent blue ribbon commission is the right way to go It s the right way to go because if this committee with it jurisdiction and it might and insight and experience and education to intelligence doe it job and by the very nature of an investigation inquiry staff doing their job over an eight month period unearthing fact covering data asking tough question they will produce even more question for u to try to answer over the next year To I think there is a compelling case by the very effectiveness of this committee to do it job near perfectly and assume it jurisdiction a a body of Congress to take on this tough task we make the case in a very convincing way for follow up and a thread attached to this for an independent blue ribbon commission to continue to look at these very very tough question a to how to reorganized an intelligence community that made mistake that committed failure that saw warning and reorganized it in a time when we are threatened by a brand new source that want to kill Americans in massive number very quickly And they can do it in this kind of world environment I think the case is made compelling for an independent blue ribbon commission And I think that complement u And I think it add into the history of this committee the Intelligence Committee which ha had independent commission a Spin Grown Part Human the NRO Rumsfeld on ICBMs and even in the Senate bill a brand new commission to study something else Is Will I do have a question or two that I wanted to ask about the classification of data In page there is a reference to information provided to senior U S government official in September of and on page mentioning senior government official in July of Now without getting into breaking our classification and we do n t want to do that one would be a Democratic administration one would be a Republican administration Is there the possibility that those reference might be could be to a White House of HILL Well you know obviously given the classification REP ROEMER I m just asking in the realm of possibility of HILL Well I guess are you asking the term senior government official could n t I mean I guess the term senior government official would be anyone at a senior level in the entire U S government To but I can not a I understand the rule on this we are not allowed REP ROEMER But your case Is Will is that it is important for the American people to know when we get intelligence that it is not only intelligence agency that act upon it it s the administration a to what they do with it with the military with other branch of government the FAA of HILL Right REP ROEMER The Order Patrol and so forth and so on of HILL That s absolutely right because to make intelligence really the way it should be important and valuable it ha to be not only collected analyzed but it ha to be disseminated to the people who can use it in a timely manner That s the whole point of having intelligence To REP ROEMER Part of our partisan effort would be to get in a partisan way this access to declassifying that kind of reference Is that your argument of HILL Well I mean our argument on this issue about the White House is that if you have classified the information itself it seems to u we do n t see the national security interest in declassifying where it go from there Of you classify it it go to some people and you should be able to classify it go to everybody or whoever it went to to explain the REP ROEMER I would hope our committee would have a long very serious discussion about what to do on the classification issue Finally Is Will if I could ask one final question you mentioned the CTC and the number of analysis that they had and I think mentioned a number of three to five of HILL Right REP ROEMER Met a we ve looked at the CTC budget over the s and a question of resource without mentioning a specific number which is classified the trend which we can talk about right of HILL Right REP ROEMER is quadrupling in the CTC budget To why is n t more money put into analysis in that budget which is quadrupling of HILL I think it s a priority question I mean it s you know a the and what we found and what we are saying is that the resource that we are getting more resource for counterterrorism prior to September th and after the DCI declared war on bin Laden it wa going up But there wa no massive shift It wa a gradual thing And in term of the analysis there wa not a significant amount of resource dedicated to it To I assume it is like every other resource allocation it is depending on where your priority are And obviously there wa not a big priority on the analysis REP ROEMER Thank you Or Chairman SEN GRAHAM Thank you Or Former Or LaHood REP LAHOOD Thank you Or Chairman Is Will thank you for your service to our committee and to your staff too I know they ve worked long hour of HILL That s very true and they ve done an excellent job They really have I agree with that And to Written and Steve thank you for if you are still here for being here and your testimony and the people that you represent Obviously our heart go out to all of you Is Will if you take all the information that s in your report today and you analyze all that information and then you look at the notion that there wa a lot of information prior to there were a lot of people in separate way who saw it and if you took that information and it wa analyzed correctly and the people responsible whether it would be the president the vice president the national security adviser the CIA director or FBI director if they had had all the information that you collected and document in your report could have been prevented Of they had seen the Phoenix meme if they had seen the meme from Minnesota Of they had seen really had all of these transit these document that had come over the transit for any number of day I mean there ha to be some idea about because the criticism is that a lot of information came but it wa n t shared a lot of information wa available but wa n t shared and the right people did n t know it Well if you take all that information and if it had been shared with the highest elected people in our government and the highest appointed people in our government who have responsibility for counteracting these activity could have been prevented of HILL By own view is that I do n t think anyone will ever be able to say no one will ever really know whether could have been prevented because what we are talking about here is we not only would have to know what everyone would have done with the information they had in the intelligence community in term of law enforcement and intelligence you would also have to know how bin Laden and the hijacker would have reacted He do n t know that I mean it s all we are hypothesizing And there ha been so much emphasis on wa there a smoking gun wa there a when where how that sort of thing He did n t find we have n t found that That we have found is a lot of information a lot of thing that were n t put together And to me maybe the biggest issue is and we say it somewhat in the statement not only that they were n t put together but they were n t recognizing the importance given everything else they should have known for instance in the summer of that s the summer that you had Midhar Alhazmi you had Phoenix you had Moussaoui you had a high threat level Well you would think with all of that when you got Phoenix or you got Moussaoui it would have been even more you would have been more aggressive with it and that did n t happen To there s a lot of unknown There s question whether people would have if you had caught hijacker would they have replaced him with someone else There s question about could you if you had gotten onto one of these case could you have survived and perhaps found what wa going on All of those are hypothetical and we are never going to know But I think what we do clearly know is that the community could have done a lot better on the intelligence side and the law enforcement side REP LAHOOD But your answer is that the community could have done a lot better But knowing what we know about information that wa there and the dot were never connected in a lot of these different area you are not saying though that the community could have prevented this They could have done a lot better but they could n t have prevented of HILL I m saying they could have REP LAHOOD But they could n t have prevented it of HILL To I did n t say that I never said they could n t have REP LAHOOD That I want to know I want you to be able to tell u pretty definitely here for these people that are here that if all the dot were connected and all the information wa shared and all the right people would have known it could we have prevented of HILL I would say REP LAHOOD That s the criticism all over this town and all over the country and all over the world that we you know we collected a lot of information but it wa n t connected that people did n t connect the dot they did n t share the information And my question is and I think it s a question on the mind of the American people if it had been done correctly could it have been prevented And people that are promoting a blue ribbon committee which I am not are saying that that s the way we get to the bottom line But I want to know from you who have been working at this now for several month could it have been prevented of HILL I I ca n t say guaranteed that it could have been prevented There could have been some thing done that there s possible that they might have been able to uncover some of this plot if they had had the information on individual and they had followed them and they had survived them And the individual had talked about something and they might have picked it up I mean all of those are is It s one if after another You re never going to know that but if you do n t get beyond the point that they could have done better you know that is what they have to do the next time Because if they do n t you re not going to have a shot at preventing this the next time That s where the issue is Not so much preventing what s already happened It s preventing what may happen in the future that we have to focus on That s my own view And I think to prevent what may happen in the future there s a lot of thing that have to be done to get u there SEN GRAHAM Thank you Or LaHood Met me say tomorrow we re going to have two panel with five person in total all of whom have had extensive experience at the highest level of actually making decision based on intelligence And I would suggest the question you just asked of Is Will would be a very appropriate question to ask of those panelist to get their assessment of whether there wa enough information from the experience and perspective that they had and can provide a to whether there wa enough to have avoided September the th Or Hoekstra REP PETER HOEKSTRA R of Thank you Or Chairman And I d like to thank the chairman for how they started off these public hearing I believe with Steve and Written today It s a very appropriate way to begin the process by remembering those whose family paid the ultimate sacrifice on September and recognizing the sense of urgency and the importance with which this committee ha to go through and conduct it work And Is Will thank you for your work of HILL Thank you REP HOEKSTRA having gone through some other investigation on other committee recognizing the importance of how you approach this work and the intensity and the professionalism and having to put up with member of Congress To thank you for being willing to go through that process Is you ve gone through and done the analysis have you also taken a look at other attempted terrorist activity during this time frame which may have been prevented because of knowledge that we had beforehand and thing that might not be part of the public record Have you uncovered anything like that of HILL You mean other action by other group or other REP HOEKSTRA By al Qaeda or other group that where they had been planning on attacking the United States and for one reason or another those attack were hearted of HILL He have heard some of that I mean we have not focused on that because we were rousing on the information on aircraft a weapon and September th But certainly in talking to people there were success by the intelligence community against al Qaeda and other terrorist group There were also you know failure REP HOEKSTRA Other failure of HILL To I mean it wa and I think I did n t read that part but in our statement we talk about the fact that they did that it wa a very difficult target for the intelligence community Ll Qaeda had a lot of operational security They were hard to penetrate They were hard to get them to talk about thing that would help you It wa difficult There were resource problem But despite all that the community did amass a lot of information on them and they were engaged in operation against al Qaeda and there were some success but there were also some failure REP HOEKSTRA Is you go through this process will you also overlay policy decision that were made either in Congress or at the executive level Specifically I think this morning Steve talked about and I m not sure exactly what the word were but the inability to penetrate organization like al Qaeda with human intelligence and recognizing that during part of the s you know there were decision that were made that changed the way that the CIA and other organization could actually recruit human intelligence of HILL I think that area I mean those are all valid policy question and it s relevant to how you you know how you combat terrorist in group like this obviously because penetrating a group like this is tremendous important It s a valuable source of intelligence But I think those are issue that we will probably address Is I understand the chairman one of the thing we want to do a we get further away from the fact we re trying to get the actual review out first That is a system problem and then look at possible way to reform the community and change and policy issue and those sort of thing To I would guess that those issue would be addressed once we get into where do we go from here in term of reform REP HOEKSTRA Because it s very very clear that the intelligence community and the various agency do n t operate in a vacuum There are policy and decision that are made over a period of time that will have an impact on the culture within the various agency a to their ability to recruit or how they will use or who they will access for human intelligence There s also decision that are made by Congress in term of the funding level and direction and those type of thing And you know a the report move forward we will get a fuller context of where the breakdown will be some of which may have occurred within the intelligence agency some of which may have occurred in other part of the executive branch or some of which may have occurred in Congress because of decision that have been made over here so that we get that full picture of what went on of HILL Right REP HOEKSTRA That will all be those are all area that you plan on looking at of HILL I mean the game plan so to speak is to look at the actual review get through that then look at the system issue and then decide how those system issue can be addressed through reform And what you re talking about I think would be in the system issue problem restriction on our ability to penetrate human source hum in and then where we go from here in term of reform REP HOEKSTRA Good Thank you Or Chairman I yield back my time SEN GRAHAM Thank you very much Senator Shelby SEN SHELBY Thank you Is Will I ve missed some of this because like everybody we have to do other thing during the meeting Would it be fair to say at this point in the inquiry the investigation that we re a long way from finishing our inquiry are we not of HILL I like to look at it I like to be optimistic rather than pessimistic And I would say I think we ve made a significant good start down the road SEN SHELBY Well I think we ve of HILL He re not finished but you know I think we ve done a fair amount of work here and we re getting we have a good record on the fact so far SEN SHELBY But you re a veteran investigator a veteran prosecution inspector general at DOD He all know this and we have a lot of respect for you But in any investigation you do n t know what s going to turn up next do you of HILL Right SEN SHELBY And you re not telling u here today and the American people that you see the end of this investigation of HILL To I think I said previously in response to another question that in any investigation the more you dig you find thing and then you have to have time to go through those thing SEN SHELBY Analyze it of HILL And we are that ha happened It s happening just like it happens in any investigation And we re trying to follow those fact where they lead Now whether all of that will be finished by whenever this is determined to end I do n t know But I think we ll make a significant contribution and will have made a good SEN SHELBY I think you re already making a significant contribution and I think the staff is By concern is that we do n t know what we do n t know of HILL Correct SEN SHELBY And I have the feeling that there s more out there because I raised this morning I raised the issue in opening statement that I do n t believe a a member of the committee that we ve had the utmost support by the agency that we re investigation And I do n t believe that we ve had the support that wa promised at the outset you know by the administration Having said that I want to focus just what little time I have on the FBI You may have talked about this earlier I know you addressed it and that is the analytical component of the FBI of HILL Right SEN SHELBY He know that the FBI ha got good people He know that they re great on investigation They have no peer I believe of HILL Right SEN SHELBY But on analysis of intelligence information some of u have been on the committee and this is my eighth year here that we ve been concerned with that for a long time It s hard to put an intelligence division or component together and make it work Well u in your judgment what wa the state of the analytical component of the FBI before September the th from what you know of HILL Well on terrorist basically yeah SEN SHELBY Is far a terrorist is concerned of HILL The FBI I mean our figure we have the figure in the statement they I think had one individual working on al Qaeda SEN SHELBY One individual working al Qaeda before September the th in the analysis of HILL Analysis right And you know my own personal view and you alluded to it and I have worked with the FBI for many many year SEN SHELBY I know you have of HILL starting when I wa a prosecution and I agree with you I think they are tremendous investigator And in term of law enforcement they can be the best on some case in prosecution But that s their mission Their mission is to do an investigation to do a prosecution to do a case Of it s their case and their mission their prosecution they will go to the th degree And they re very aggressive and we need that But they are not at least in my experience their training and their mission doe not focus on going beyond that into the broader analytical world and looking at the big picture They are focused on their case And it s too bad because their aggressiveness would be very good if they could also channel it at least on issue like terrorist a little broader onto the analytical SEN SHELBY Well before September th they only had one person in the whole bureau working on that you just testified to Is that correct In al Qaeda of HILL Yeah And I just have a note from our staff who ha done a lot of these interview that it wa at the FBI they had one individual doing strategic analysis is what we re talking about SEN SHELBY That s right of HILL They did have some others that were doing a she call operational analysis which I interpret that to mean that wa connected with prosecution and case To there were individual doing that SEN SHELBY To we think that there is a way to get the FBI changed or at least part of it toward strategic analysis of information dealing with terrorist in the future I know we talked to the director about this But that s harder to do than it is to say is n t it of HILL Well I think it s not only getting them to expand their focus I mean it s like any job or profession in an agency They have to be able to give people incentive in term of career and profession and those sort of thing to make the analysis position in the FBI important position that people want to do SEN SHELBY One of my light is on I guess I ll I ll wait another round Or Chairman REP GOSS Is Pelosi REP PELOSI Thank you very much Or Chairman I want to join others in commending Is Will on the excellent work that she and the member of her very able staff have performed I hope I hope that it is a comfort to the family to know how persistent and thorough this staff is in this investigation in this inquiry however limited it is strictly to intelligence And a wa mentioned earlier there are other agency of government beyond the intelligence community that need some review a well The question of could it have been prevented of course is one that will haunt u a long a we exist a a country And there s no good answer The good news is the bad news Of the answer is no it could not have been prevented that mean we re very exposed in the future Of it mean yes it could have been prevented that s good news because that bodes well for the future but it s a tragedy obviously for the family It s a tragedy in any event but if it could have been prevented we ll all be haunted by the guilt associated with that And that s not even good enough punishment for u There will be hell to that s going up to September th Most September th if any of these agency of government in the intelligence community are not dealing honestly with u and by that I mean being forthcoming with information if a Or Shelby say there s other information to come that we do n t know about now I believe there will be hell to pay for them because we all assume that everyone is doing their best to protect our country and they must help u get to the bottom of this I trust that they are helping u all they can but we must continue the inquiry I think a one who originally supported an independent commission I wa original author of it and we passed in committee we failed on the floor the idea I think is an important one However it doe not in any way undermine the important work of this inquiry Is Or Former ha said and others have said this piece of it that go into the intelligence committee is very important He could have had the best intelligence in the world though and what we found out wa that since September th is that the hijacker and the al Qaeda knew something about u that we did not know about ourselves and that is that we had tremendous exposure at the airport That all four of these hijacking could have been successful is remarkable I find it remarkable that maybe one would get by but four of them to succeed in their word succeed is remarkable to me To my question to you Is Will is on this subject your report is clear but I would just like to see if you could shed some further light Is you were looking into this issue of the hijacker and we ll go more into it in a couple of day but did you see a distinction made between hacking of course tat s a predictable threat to u and using airplane a weapon a two distinct threat Because from our perspective many of u a hacking is still the loss of many many life and should have been taken a seriously a hacking with intent to do further damage of HILL Well we certainly when we went out looking for information and requesting information from the agency distinguished it because we were asking for information on the use of aircraft a weapon To that would imply more than the usual just jack a plane to get somewhere or take hostage or whatever But in term of you know being prepared to address it and your comment about why you know why they were able to jack all four of these plan and our defense were down there s probably le of a distinction And I point to the FAA FBI assessment that we quote in this staff statement I think that year which wa I believe they were looking at the whole threat terrorist threat to civil aviation To they were not distinguishing between aircraft a weapon or hacking And what wa interesting about it is that they were concluding that there wa a small domestic threat so they were not too concerned about any sort of terrorist threat to domestic U S aviation here in the United States a late a REP PELOSI Well I find that to be a serious shortcoming of HILL Right REP PELOSI separate and apart from not knowing the time and place and date of HILL Right REP PELOSI the fact that the entire threat wa minimize to that extent To I do see the need a I had said before to ass the performance of any agency beyond the intelligence agency which have a responsibility to protect act of terrorist and to look with fresh eye and some innovative thinking on our intelligence and all other aspect of protecting the American people in this regard And of course a Senator Rockefeller said we must do it right But I think doing it right also mean protecting our civil liberty To we have quite a challenge And your presentation this morning and the work of your staff ha been a valuable contribution Thank you of HILL Thank you REP PELOSI I look forward to following hearing Thank you Or Chairman SEN GRAHAM Thank you Is Pelosi Or Loss REP GOSS Thank you Met me advise member of the House that there s minute left on a vote in the House so my wrap up will be very quick First of all I want to thank Is Will for a very excellent presentation of HILL Thank you REP GOSS I liked the version that we had before it had been reacted better and I expect that we are going to continue to press on because I do believe that there is more that can be revealed And along that area is it fair for me to make a statement that because of the joint staff we now know some thing that we otherwise certainly would not have known Is that a fair statement of HILL I would hope so yes I would say so REP GOSS That is certainly my feeling a well And I hope that much of that can be shared with the American people The second question I wanted to ask or provide some guidance on from my perspective is in your excellent report this morning on intelligence reporting on bin Laden s intention to strike inside the United States on page and of your report and were a series of specific that cry out to say Why wa all this ignored There wa the audience Why wa nobody listening And one of the issue that I would like to have further amplification on this is if this wa percent of the reporting what wa the other percent of the reporting that wa consuming the analysis time in the intelligence community I m not asking for an answer now of HILL Right REP GOSS I think that is going to be helpful for our report The next question I think is self evident and others have said it There s no doubt that some of the question member here have addressed today to you are more appropriate for witness that will be forthcoming and I want to make sure that we understand that there will be other witness forthcoming and we will try and have a much of that a public a we can a it should be But the very penetrating question that were asked by Is Breitweiser and Or Rush and the recommendation I think are an excellent point and each one of them deserves consideration and we ll get them at some point In fact some of them have already been given consideration a I m sure you know And finally with regard to the remark about Senator Even and Senator Rockefeller on classification my view is that the burden is on the administration to tell u why we must preserve classification unless it s in those area those exempt area that I spoke to source method plan and intention and going prosecution by the Justice Department The final point I would make is that the work of this committee will be done There is no question about that And there will continue to be oversight by the United States Congress in a number of area including in the intelligence committee no matter who the member are of that committee To this is an issue that is not going to be dropped merely because another date lip up on a calendar or there is a change of personnel somewhere in the establishment His will go forward because the American people deserve the answer and they will get the answer And I thank you very much for your participation today and an excellent job Is Will of HILL Thank you REP GOSS Thank you Or Chairman SEN GRAHAM Thank you Or Loss Senator Feinstein SEN FEINSTEIN Thank you very much Or Chairman I certainly concur with the remark that have been made about the excellence of the report of HILL Thank you SEN FEINSTEIN I m just sorry I could n t get it until the meeting so I had to spend my time reading it during the meeting which Or Chairman I would suggest is not the best way of enabling u to carry out our duty SEN GRAHAM Senator a you know we made the original non reacted version available in both the House and the Senate Intelligence Committee room and I understand that you took advantage of that Unfortunately it wa only within the last le than hour that we got back from the classification agency the version that we could make public I hope that in the future we and they will do a better job and a more expedition job so that will give u an opportunity to know what s going to be public with more lead time SEN FEINSTEIN I thank you Or Chairman Is Will on December the th the DCI told his deputy in a meme about bin Laden and al Qaeda that He are at war I want no resource or people spared in this effort either inside CIA or the community Met in your testimony you indicate that when it came time to translate that declaration of war into real resource the government s effort fell joyfully short Specifically you concluded that the allocation of intelligence community resource did not adequately reflect the true war against bin Laden For example you point out in the CTC at CIA had only three analysis assigned to the bin Laden network worldwide And after that number had risen to just five and that thing were even worse outside the CIA The international terrorist analysis unit at the FBI had in place only one analyst to address al Qaeda this out of an intelligent budget of literally billion of dollar every year Now it really concern me because I wa one that felt very strongly that the warning that something wa going to happen were there and certainly by July I wa just based on what I heard in this committee percent certain that something wa going to happen I even said that on national television that I thought it wa going to happen within the next three month And my question really go to the fact that whether today even we have enough to do what we need to do why do you think so little attention even after these declaration of war were really paid when it came to devoting real resource and what wa taking a higher priority of HILL I I think we have asked that to many people in the community and I will give you again I have to be careful the detail of it because we are in a public session But I think what we are hearing is that there were other priority that the intelligence one reaction would be that people would tell you that the intelligence community responds to it customer customer being other part of government that are taking them to come up with intelligence on certain item and that in some respect there were customer that they had to satisfy they felt they had to satisfy and were told to satisfy on other topic other than al Qaeda To that wa one issue that we ve heard He have heard in the FBI on this the resource There wa a we just discussed with Senator Shelby there wa not many there wa like one strategic analyst for al Qaeda in the FBI There were some more analysis on operation and there wa a much bigger emphasis in the FBI on operation on case investigation a opposed to strategic analysis even though it wa on al Qaeda which wa a high threat But their mission wa more focused on actual prosecution and case To I think a with any resource issue it wa a question of other priority customer demanding other thing and the agency responding to them SEN FEINSTEIN To you believe that today there are sufficient resource of HILL He have not senator you know we know some of the detail a to how thing have jumped since September th in term of resource but we have not focused intently on what is going on post September th because our job ha been to try and find out what wa happening before September th To I would n t I really would not feel probably qualified to start guessing a to whether it s adequate now SEN FEINSTEIN In page SEN GRAHAM Senator we will have another round after this round SEN FEINSTEIN I do n t even get the time our question took up Never mind Thank you SEN GRAHAM Senator Nikolski SEN MIKULSKI Thank you very much Or Chairman Or Chairman a few word to the family and then a question for Is Will To the family first of all my name is Barbara Nikolski I am a United States senator and I am from the state of Maryland I had people die at the World Trade Enter and I also had Marylanders die at the Pentagon in the plane and in the inferior there I also believe I owe my life to the gallantry of the men and woman who fought on because I do believe the plane wa heading towards u And I have two constituent who died in the anthrax attack on u To know that I am absolutely on your side And I want you to know that I thank you today for coming because you show such inspiration strength and courage and I believe you have a right to know about what happened you have a right to be heard in any public forum and I believe Americans have a right to be protected I know that you are still looking for answer on why this happened how it happened and how it doe n t happen again Now I would support a vote to establish an independent commission I believe my committee ha done an outstanding job But I believe when such an impact happens to America and it family we need more than one opinion on how to make sure it never happens again That I find I find many thing about what happened troubling But what I find most troubling is that four of the terrorist were stopped by local law enforcement four for speeding and one for not having a driver s license They were actually in the hand of law enforcement But when they were stopped and the police went to check the database nothing averted them to detain these men Something is wrong here State trooper like the one in my own state that stopped one of these thus and other police officer know more when they check their database know more about men being behind in their child support the database will tell them than they do about men who are possibly around a terrorist attack There are more than different watch list to keep track of people dangerous to the United States But guess what if you are a watch list you do n t talk to other watch list Of you are a watch list you like live in one of those case You might not know if there are other watch list out there You do n t tell anyone that you are a watch list and you certainly do n t talk to each other make friend with the other watch list or make friend with law enforcement That s really I think unacceptable And these will be the question I am going to direct to Is Will because like you I want to be sure that this committee get answer for you and the rest of America on how we can detect deter disrupt and defeat any attack on the United States of America And having said that Is Will you know about these watch list you know that they are all over the place and they are nowhere In our work with you and my colleague I wanted to see if there wa a smoking gun I wanted to know what were the system problem and what were the solution I am not sure there is a smoking gun but these watch list are definitely a system problem Would you elaborate them the one you can or where you would see solution are going on the watch list of HILL The watch list issue senator we are I am aware of it He are going to go into that in more detail when we get to the hearing on the hijacker because a you alluded to that is an issue regarding Midhar and Alhamzi I mean that s a very big issue It s an issue of getting it on the right watch list getting it to the right people But even before that it s also an issue of getting it between the intelligence community and the law enforcement community and breaking down the reluctance sometimes to share information across the from the intelligence community to the criminal investigator and law enforcement on the other side And that I think may also play on some of this To but those are issue that we will talk about when we look at the hijacker case And you are right they are a problem SEN MIKULSKI Well let me just say this before the yellow go to red I raised the issue of a smoking gun I have been in many hearing To you believe that there is a smoking gun on what went wrong or wa it just a series of total disconnected of HILL Well we of course I am handicapped in answering that because we are in a public session and we are still looking at a number of other issue that have come up But I do n t think in any of what we have seen here smoking gun if you mean by smoking gun that somebody had information of when where how this wa going to happen in the United States government we have not found that But you know I had a discussion actually with one of our staff on this the other day and he pointed out wisely that there ha been so much discussion about looking for a smoking gun The truth is you hardly ever get a quote smoking gun in not just terrorist but in a criminal case et center et center And if by rousing all the time on we have the smoking gun you know we have to be ready to go if we have a smoking gun the truth is most of the time you will never have a smoking gun and it is a lot harder to find it when you do n t have one To what we ought to be rousing on is how to get our system ready to find these gun when you do n t have a smoking gun which is what you are going to be faced with most of the time just you know the odds are you are not going to have that And we need to have our intelligence and law enforcement people good enough and bright enough and aggressive enough that they can track these gun down and find this even when there is no smoking gun because my own experience at least in law enforcement is that s what you have most of the time SEN MIKULSKI Thank you SEN GRAHAM Thank you senator Senator By And Senator By ha submitted an opening statement which will be placed in the record SEN KYL Thank you Or Chairman By the way I think that last point is a very important point that need to be underscored and it s one of the most important thing that come from this from your statement today Is Will of HILL Thank you senator SEN KYL I wa this morning detained in my office waiting for a couple of phone call but I had my television on the entire time and wa privileged to hear not only the statement of the chairman of our committee but also the statement made by Is Breitweiser and Or Rush And a ha been expressed by others here my heart go out to them and the family and family that they represent And I think that I should state that I am certain that every American share their grief and their anger and even their frustration And I also share their view that there s more we could have done to try to prevent the terrorist we experienced on September th I also agree with Cleaner Will that at the end of the day it is doubtful we will ever find a smoking gun But a she said the important point is to be in a better position to deal with the other piece of information in order to try to prevent this in the future I do think Or Chairman that it is very unclear whether the joint investigation the joint committee investigation that we are engaged in here and whatever report we eventually submit will satisfy these witness and those that they represent or whether they will satisfy member of this committee let alone the other member of the House and the Senate Is you know Or Chairman I have expressed serious reservation about the direction of our investigation including the allocation of time and resource to holding open hearing at this time before we have finished our work Ours is a large undertaking and we have got a lot more work to do before our fast approaching deadline And yet we are proceeding with public hearing in spite of not having completed that investigation That wa presented today wa only a staff document I am talking now about the testimony of Is Will It wa not a consensus product The committee member had no practical input into this interim report I think the public should know Ordinarily we investigate we write our report and then we present our recommendation The staff s presentation of it interim report before member getting is therefore in my view premature a well a a diversion of the joint staff from the investigation that we have given them the job to do The interim statement from our joint inquiry staff provides some very valuable information about what ha been done to date a chronology of event leading to the September th attack and some background information about the growing threat of al Qaeda over the last decade It is very useful to have this history and it s important to make it public But the committee should have approved it first And in any event the release of the report could have been done without taking the time to have it read by the staff director But more importantly I believe that question fundamental to our investigation have yet to be pursued adequately These include include but are not limited to whether part of the pre September th problem wa a result of a culture of risk aversion in the intelligence community and or an inadequate allocation and improper prioritization of resource to those on the front line of our counterterror effort Or Chairman you know I have expressed before my concern that committee member have been able to play only a limited role in this inquiry It s largely being conducted by the joint committee staff with little input by or to our own committee staff let alone the member themselves And that will make it difficult to concur in the final product without reservation He will not know what we have n t been told and therefore we will not be able to touch unequivocal for the final product Questions about this investigation process have led to call for the creation of a national commission to investigate all of these matter His would further stress the intelligence community at the very time we are trying to fight the war on terrorist While it may be deemed necessary it can hardly be deemed desirable To I hope Or Chairman that we can continue to work to resolve these issue Only by doing our very best will we have done our duty to the victim who are represented here today and to the American people SEN GRAHAM Senator thank you Senator May is supposed to be en route Of Senator Shelby ha SEN SHELBY Of you will let me ask until he come SEN GRAHAM And then I have a couple of question I am going to ask at the conclusion of Senator May s question Senator Shelby SEN SHELBY Mrs Will I would like to go back to the FBI and the analytical component we were talking about earlier of HILL Right right SEN SHELBY or lack thereof In your investigation regarding the analytical ability of the FBI do you know if the FBI prior to September the th ever did an analysis of terrorist tactic That is terrorist tactic with the possible use of airplane a weapon of HILL I do n t believe so He a I think SEN SHELBY You re saying no of HILL Is the statement say we have n t found any analysis of the use of aircraft a weapon in the community a far a I know including the FBI SEN SHELBY In the community you are talking about the intelligence community of HILL Yeah but we would include SEN SHELBY Not just the FBI of HILL Right I think it s safe to say the FBI also SEN SHELBY Now in your statement I believe it s on page not without reading it all and I ll quote some of it It say In April the intelligence community obtained information regarding an alleged bin Laden threat to jack a The source wa a walk in to the FBI s Newark office claiming that he had been to a training camp in Pakistan where he learned hacking technique and received arm training He also stated that he wa supposed to meet five or six other individual in the U S who would participate in the plot And I ll read further They were instructed to use all necessary force to take over the plane because there would be pilot among the hacking team The plan wa to fly the plane to Afghanistan and if they could not make it there they would blow up the plane His is part of your report is that right of HILL Right SEN SHELBY Now were they I believe there wa another report August according to page of your report In August of the intelligence community obtained information regarding a plot to either bomb the U S Embassy in Nairobi from an airplane or crash an airplane into it The intelligence community learned that two people who were reportedly acting on instruction from bin Laden met in October to discus this plot And then we go back and you ve touched on this I believe I know we ve had hearing on it About the Philippine situation of HILL Right SEN SHELBY There there wa information that they could use airplane a weapon and so forth of HILL Right correct SEN SHELBY In the light of part of your statement I just referred to you re saying that they re according to your investigation there wa not any analysis of these terrorist tactic in the intelligence community regarding the of HILL There wa no there wa no analysis of the likelihood of the use of airplane a weapon a a terrorist tactic SEN SHELBY I wonder why not of HILL I would hypothesis that what I mean when we we ve asked question of people It s a resource issue People say they were overwhelmed The other thing and I mentioned this earlier I do n t think anyone had pulled a we did I mean the reason the way we got this information is by going to the agency and saying we want everything you have on the use of aircraft a weapon To we have then pulled out of this huge amount of data they have and come up with enough to show that there wa this trend and this theme going through some of the reporting SEN SHELBY His wa not on September th something new or should n t have been something new His wa stuff that had been out there at least since before then and I believe you talked about the Paris incident where the French of HILL The Differ Power SEN SHELBY Oh yeah the Differ Power deal the Philippine deal these reporting that you listed To when people come up and they say Most we were shocked that they would use weapon use airplane a weapon and we did n t do any analysis of that in the community are you kind of shocked or surprised of HILL Well it wa there I mean the information wa there SEN SHELBY The information wa there if they had it analyzed a far a the potential tactic of the hijacker is that right of HILL Yeah I mean based on what we ve seen this wa not a new idea a of September th SEN SHELBY Thank you Or Chairman SEN GRAHAM Senator Urban SEN RICHARD DURBIN D of Thank you Or Chairman And I apologize for not being here earlier but I had a Judiciary Committee hearing which ran in conflict with this hearing today And I thank you Or Chairman Senator Shelby and our counterpart in the House for the time that we put into this effort and your leadership in bringing u to this moment I personally feel that we have identified some thing of value in term of shortcoming from the government s point of view prior to September th He have identified a lack of communication among the intelligence agency and I m afraid that today although there s been an improvement there is still much room for improvement I have focused primarily on the issue of information technology and I have been chagrined and disappointed by the report about the lack of coordination of the computer architecture of the federal government so that agency intelligence agency can share information effectively Governor Ridge referred to this a a force multiplied and it would be but it is not because of those shortcoming He have also considered the result of those shortcoming and not the least of which wa the example of the Phoenix meme which should have been but wa not brought to the attention of or analyzed by counter terrorist force That meme might might have at least helped u to be better prepared for what occurred on September th though I do n t want to suggest that anyone saw this coming in it specific but it s certainly raised question which should have been pursued and were not I think recalling some of the testimony we received there wa clearly a lack of follow up at the FBI and a lack of involvement by the CIA The same thing hold true for the Moussaoui arrest and the disclosure that came out of the FBI afterwards again evincing a lack of coordination a lack of sharing of vital information that could have had u better prepared to defend America Those two instance though I would like to bring to the attention of this joint inquiry have come to the public eye because of lead lead by the administration lead from Capitol Will of vital information It strike me a unwise and unfair for u to expect there to be a thorough investigation of what led up to September th based on the possibility of lead coming from anywhere History ha told u that it is far better to have a public hearing a public investigation and the involvement of third party when it come to signing blame and perhaps suggesting meaningful and painful reform but that ha not been the case here I think we are doing what we set out to do to try to find way to improve the working of the intelligence community to avoid a future September th but we will never be able to satisfy the need and curiosity of the American people about whether their government did everything it could to protect them in closed hearing with occasional lead That is not going to serve the need of America Applause I know that earlier today there wa testimony of one of the widow of a victim of September th and I have met in my office with some of those same victim and the family in painful meeting There is an anger and a sadness in the message that they bring to Congress but there is certainly I think wisdom in what they ve suggested Met u do our business here let u try to find even within closed hearing way to improve the intelligence committee and community but let s not forget our primary obligation to the people of this country He do not serve the need of an open society with closed hearing in relation to an attack on America virtually unprecedented in our history It is time for u to acknowledge the obvious He need a third party investigation people that we can trust who have no political animus who are going to come to this a loyal Americans to try to help u be a safer nation I commend the staff They have done heroic work and I know have worked long and hard to bring the report that we have today And we should continue to meet our mandate a best we can but let u not believe that this chapter ha been closed in American history He have merely addressed the forward with this investigation now we must get into the substance and do it in a public way That s not to diminish any of the effort of my colleague or anyone on this committee but I think we owe it to the American people to give them more Thank you Or Chairman SEN GRAHAM I would like to ask a question and then make a comment The question ha to do with the relationship between intelligence and effecting the operation of a governmental agency You have five or more page in which you outline the example of the use of commercial aviation a a weapon of mass destruction Is I understand the history generally the taking of an airplane by hijacker ha been done for either a political or an economic purpose that in light of that the standard protocol what a crew is supposed to do if they are subjected to hacking is to cooperate to acquiesce to try to get the airplane on the ground and then start the process of negotiating with the hijacker From your review is that an accurate statement of HILL Yes I think that s correct and that wa traditionally the way you would deal with a hacking SEN GRAHAM And I believe it wa reflected in the way in which the first three plane that were hacked on September th reacted It wa not until the information of the first three plane became known to the person on the fourth plane that there wa a resistance to the hijacker and a a result the plane crashed in Pennsylvania With the kind of intelligence information that there might be a shift in the way in which hijacker and aircraft interrelated that is instead of taking the airplane for a political or economic purpose that the plane itself might be converted into a weapon and used in the horrified manner that it wa Was that information from the intelligence community transmitted to either the FAA or the commercial aviation industry so that it might affect the way in which they advise crew a to how to respond to a hacking of HILL I ca n t say that all that information wa transmitted to the FAA The FAA did get some of it and we talk about their analysis of the threat to civil aviation By own read on it is I do n t think that to the extent the FAA got the information there wa a real recognition that this wa a serious threat I mean certainly you re correct I mean if they had changed their focus from hacking for ransom or to take the plane and fly it somewhere else or hostage or whatever if that had changed to the use of an aircraft a a weapon you would have had to change the entire midst and training that wa given to the flight crew for instance and the security in the plane and everything and that obviously did not happen because a of September th you re absolutely correct it did n t happen on September th until evidently the passenger in the fourth plane became aware of what wa going on but that wa not the flight crew up to that point I assume were following the standard protocol for dealing with a hacking But that issue underscore the importance of someone recognizing in the community the intelligence community that this wa a serious threat and there wa a stream of information there and that perhaps it wa serious enough and the likelihood wa serious enough that they needed to address not only dissemination it but telling policymakers in those other agency that this wa a threat they now had to be prepared to meet SEN GRAHAM One of my criticism of the threat that are being issued to the general public including the one within the last two week is that what s lacking is the follow on of what is the citizen who receives this information that they re living in a heightened threat environment supposed to do to protect themselves their family their community And here we have a case of where intelligence information wa sent to a sophisticated industry commercial aviation apparently without any direction a to how the industry should use the information and the consequence wa they did n t use the information and that contributed to what happened on September th I d like to ask if we might pursue that issue because I think it is a metaphor for the larger issue of how do you get intelligence from the theoretical to actually affecting the way people function and how they use that information to reduce their vulnerability to a particular threat Senator Feinstein SENATOR FEINSTEIN I think Senator define wa before me Or Chairman SEN GRAHAM Oh I m sorry Senator define I m sorry SEN DEWINE Or Chairman I do n t have any further question Thank you SEN GRAHAM Senator Feinstein SEN FEINSTEIN May I Or Chairman Is Will of HILL Yes Senator SEN FEINSTEIN I wanted to kind of follow up on where I wa trying to go with this The year wa a very big year in the early spring with a lot of piece of intelligence coming in In reading your report the year also appears to have been a very big year for all kind of piece And I wanted to see if we could n t go into some of those piece a little bit more There contained on page on your written statement you talk about the use of front for terrorist activity talk about flying an aircraft loaded with explosive into an airport and decorating it Ll Qaeda wa trying to establish an operative cell within the United States A bin Laden plot involving aircraft in New Work and Washington Recruiting a group of five to seven young men from the United States to travel to the Middle Last for training Reward money for assassination of four top intelligence agency officer and on like that And then of course the war that wa declared in the CIA of HILL Right SEN FEINSTEIN An you go into any more detail on any of these individual piece of intelligence and how they were used from an intelligence perspective to try to weave an intelligence web Because it seems to me with this and then unfortunately in July of with the Phoenix meme and then in August with Moussaoui and I do n t know what wa in his computer or in his possession but I would suggest if you took those piece and the other piece one might be able to weave together a rather significant scheme An you give u any more information of HILL I ca n t I do n t think I can give you more information on the actual report because a I mentioned at the outset the language that we have in this statement is what ha been classified To to venture beyond that language that is the language that the classification group basically signed off on a suitable for public release I ca n t go into much more detail about the language of the report He did go on some of these to the FBI and asked them what they did with some of this information or what happened to it when the report came in if they got it and I can tell you some of them and we ve given them a whole list and some we still have not gotten response They are still trying to find out what they did or locate the record Others they have found For instance I think you mentioned the information concerning a bin Laden plot involving aircraft in New Work and Washington The FBI I can tell you did receive that information and they worked actually with local law enforcement to try to verify the report but they were not able to corroborate the report and took no further action is what we have been told In September we had one where we did get a response from the FBI His wa the one about that they obtained information that bin Laden s next operation could involve flying an aircraft loaded with explosive into a U S airport and decorating it He asked the FBI if they got that information and what did they do with it They did receive the information and they also worked with another agency government agency to try to verify the information The source of the information said that another individual had advanced knowledge of some of bin Laden s operation and had given him the information about bin Laden s attack or this report The FBI tell u that they tried to work with other agency and did verify portion of this account but they were not able to locate the individual who reportedly had the advanced knowledge And after September th they actually went back to this report and tried to locate that individual again and were unable to do so To what we tried to do when we got these report that we felt were significant wa we tried particularly the one there were many in involving domestic U S attack and on those we went back to the FBI a I said and have asked them Did you get the report what did you do to verify it or did you take any action and they have come back to u on some of them Some of them there are a number of them they are still trying to go through their record and come up with an answer a to whether they got it and if so what they did with it But those two are example of the type of thing we re getting from them SEN FEINSTEIN Thank you Or Chairman just one quick comment if I might I think this report becomes kind of a basic prime on I m sure more will be filled in a time go on but I find it a very valuable document in establishing a chronology of what wa known when it wa known the fragmentary message that come through here and my hope is a these hearing go on and particularly when we get to the Phoenix meme and the Moussaoui case that we might be able to ask some question and I do n t know in public session if we will about if there had been a FISA warrant on Moussaoui and the information made available whether that would have been substantial enough to really ring a very strong bell But I wanted to thank the staff and Is Will and also thank the victim who were here today It s very special and I hope you know that we really do care and that you really do have our sympathy and our determination to get at the heart of it SEN GRAHAM And Senator I share those comment and I would say that within the next week or ten day we will have a further specific hearing on the issue that surround the Moussaoui case and that would be a very excellent opportunity to bore in at the level of detail that you ve indicated your interested in I did n t get a chance in my first round to make my comment so I will do so unless anyone doe anyone have any remaining question To this will be the last word To me one of the lesson that we have been learning and today we learned it at a new depth is how difficult it is to get an organization which ha been doing it business important business in a particular pattern for an extended period of time to be flexible enough to recognize that the environment ha shifted and it is going to have to change it pattern of business In the case of the intelligence agency they were a child born in and grew up in the Old War Very experience that the U S intelligence service had wa a post experience because we did n t have any civilian intelligence service in the United States prior to I contrast that with for instance the British who have had an intelligence service since the Napoleonic Wars To it is not surprising that when the Old War ended the agency continued to act pretty much the way they did while the Old War wa still underway because that wa the only environment in which they d ever function or known He ve had some example I think in the report that Is Will ha given u today the difficulty in establishing priority Even though we declared that terrorist and Same bin Laden specifically wa such an adversary that we were at war with him we did n t change resource commensurate with that decision He did not recognize that terrorist wa now becoming a domestic threat because historically we thought of terrorist a something that happened abroad and the new creative us that the hijacker were about to make of commercial milliner To longer were they passive instrument to try to use to secure money or some political advantage they had themselves become a weapon of mass destruction To I see a one of our challenge a we move from what we are learning to what we are going to prescribe for the future is to how can we build in to our intelligence community a greater capability of internal adapting He certainly do n t want to leave this issue for the future that will require a repetition of September the th to get to grab u by the sleeve and say you know you ve got to change because your old way are threatening the security of the American people And how we go about doing that I suggest will be one of our major task and if we are successful one of our major accomplishment Of there is no further statement a I indicated earlier the record will be open for hour if anyone ha any additional material they would like to submit I want to especially thank the family who are represented here today and especially to Written who I see is still with u and also Stephen for their excellent presentation which started our public hearing with the appropriate recognition of why we are here and we are here because of you Thank you SEN SHELBY Or Chairman what s the schedule for the rest of the week SEN GRAHAM Is Will do you want to review tomorrow of HILL I believe tomorrow we are going to have a public hearing in this room beginning at and there will be two panel of user of intelligence product from the intelligence community and those user will be senior government official over several administration I believe tomorrow we will have Or Wolfowitz the deputy secretary of defense Or Armitage the deputy secretary of state Rent Scowcroft former National Security Advisory Bony Take former National Security Advisory and Bandy Merger former National Security Adviser SEN SHELBY Will we start at of HILL SEN GRAHAM He ll start at and assuming that the star line up properly and we can accomplish this our goal would be to complete the first panel which will be Or Wolfowitz and Or Armitage in approximately three hour have a break and then return at and have the second panel run approximately another I m corrected The second panel is going to start at so that we can try to finish at approximately with both panel of HILL That s correct SEN GRAHAM Are we at a point Is Will we can comment on Friday yet of HILL I think we re still engaged in going discussion on Friday SEN GRAHAM Okay thank you The hearing is adjourned END ,2002-09-18 05:00:00+00:00,"Following is the full transcript of the testimony yesterday of Eleanor Hill, staff director of an inquiry into the Sept. 11 attacks, before a joint Congressional committee, as transcribed by the Federal News Service Inc. SEN. GRAHAM: Ms. Eleanor Hill, staff director of the joint inquiry committee. MS. HILL: Good morning, senator. Good morning, Chairman Graham, Chairman Goss, members of these committees. Before I proceed with my statement, I have a long written statement which I would like to submit for the record, and I am going to orally summarize it, given the length of what we have here. SEN. GRAHAM: Your full statement will appear in the record. MS. HILL: Thank you. But before I get into the main part of the statement, I do want to make clear to you and members of the committee that the information that is in this statement that we are going to present this morning has been cleared for public release. And, as I think most of you know, much of the information that our staff has been working on over the last several months is obviously highly classified, or has been highly classified. In the course of the last two months, we have been working with the intelligence community in a long, and what I would call a very arduous process, to declassify much of the information that we have reviewed and that we believe is important to the public's understanding of why the intelligence community did not know of the Sept. 11 attacks in advance. And I would point out that that process -- we want to say for the record that we appreciate the many long hours that have been put into that process, in what I believe for the most part has been very constructive cooperation with the executive branch on that process. A good number of professionals from the community have been in working groups and have gone over with our staff the details of this information, to put it in a form where it could be released publicly. So there have -- we have made very good progress. But I do need to report that by late last night we were able to resolve all but two issues about relevant information -- two issues where we believed relevant information to the inquiry has not yet, despite our discussions with the executive branch, been declassified. And I want to make reference to those two issues, because this statement has been prepared, recognizing that those two areas remain classified. The two areas are any references to the intelligence community providing information to the president or the White House, and the identity of and information on a key al Qaeda leader involved in the Sept. 11 attacks. According to the White House and the D.C.I., director of central intelligence, the president's knowledge of intelligence information relevant to this inquiry remains classified, even when the substance of that intelligence information has been declassified. With respect to the key al Qaeda leader involved in the September 11th attacks, I am advised this morning that the White House, and not the D.C.I., has declined to declassify his identity, despite an enormous volume of media reporting on this individual that has been out there for some time. The joint inquiry staff disagrees on both of those issues. We believe the public has an interest in this information, and that public disclosure would not harm national security. However, as I believe you know, we do not have the independent authority to declassify intelligence information short of a lengthy procedure in the U.S. Congress. And we therefore have prepared this statement without detailed descriptions of our work in those two areas. REP. TIM ROEMER (D-IN): Mr. Chairman? A parliamentary inquiry. SEN. GRAHAM: Mr. Roemer. REP. ROEMER: Are the committees bound by the classification decisions made in these two instances? SEN. GRAHAM: It is our advice from staff director and counsel that we do not independently have the authority to declassify material, and therefore we are constrained by the decisions made by those who have that legal responsibility. REP. ROEMER: A further parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Chairman. Is there a process then that either the committee or the Congress can undertake to challenge a classification decision such as that? SEN. GRAHAM: The answer is yes. And I would like -- Ms. Hill alluded to the fact that there was such a process. I think she described it as being cumbersome. If you or counsel might briefly explain what the option is to Congress. MS. HILL: Mr. Chairman, I am not an expert on the committee process. As I understand it, from speaking with the full committee counsel on this, it is -- it would require the Congress to -- you would have to have a vote -- I am not sure the full Congress or the Senate or House -- but there's a vote involved. You would have to run it through. The Congress itself would have to override that classification decision. The reason that we did not originate this information under the classification decision, the agency that originates it makes the classification and declassifies it. And in this instance that would not be the Congress. So the only alternative would be to go through this rather what I am told is a lengthy, rather prolonged process. I should point out that right before the hearing this morning I was advised by the White House that they were going to look at these two issues again, and they thought they would review it again within the next 48 hours. And I advised them that if their position changes please to advise the committees, and we could always issue a supplemental statement on those two issues for the record. So I -- my assumption is they are still reviewing it. REP. ROEMER: A final parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Chairman. Does the chairman intend to have this committee consider or debate that kind of process? I am not advocating that we challenge it at this point, but certainly understanding more from the joint inquiry staff that strongly disagrees with the decision as to why it might be helpful in a deliberative sense for the committee? SEN. GRAHAM: I think there are two questions in your inquiry. One is whether we might consider utilizing the currently existing process in this or future instances in which we have a disagreement as to whether the information which is being withheld is in fact classified information; i.e., that it relates to the national security. The second question might be as part of our final report we might want to recommend to our colleagues a change in the law that relates to the congressional role in declassification, so that it would be more available as an alternative in the event that there was a disagreement between Congress and an executive classifying agency. REP. ROEMER: Well, Mr. Chairman, thank you. I hope we do have a robust discussion of this, and I appreciate your patience. REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): Mr. Chairman? SEN. GRAHAM: Yes, Ms. Pelosi? REP. PELOSI: Mr. Chairman, I wish -- thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to join you in your earlier comments commending Eleanor Hill and Rick Sikagon (ph) and the joint inquiry staff for their fine work. And I want to inquire if it's possible just on this point, that the parliamentary inquiry that Mr. Roemer brought up. If Ms. Hill could just clarify -- it says any reference to the intelligence community providing information to the president or the White House. Could you give us an example of that? MS. HILL: What we are referring to, it's obvious and it's clear as you go through this statement that I am about to present, that we are talking about a number of intelligence reports which we have had declassified through this process. And part of our role was not just looking at what was the reporting, but where the reporting went. And you will note that this statement includes many intelligence reports, and in some instances they were provided to ``senior government officials,"" I believe is the wording that's used. But there is no reference on any of the pages as to whether the president received that information or not. And we have been told that that information -- in other words, not what is in the report but whether or not it went to the president -- would be classified under this decision. REP. PELOSI: And when you say the president, you mean any president historically. MS. HILL: That's correct. And clearly, if you look at the statement, the reporting has dates on it and the reporting is not just reporting that would have been under the current administration, but also reporting that was made under the prior administration. And the decision, in fairness, obviously, to the White House, it is not simply as to this sitting president but as to any president. REP. PELOSI: Well, I would hope, Mr. Chairman, whoever is presiding here, that Mr. Roemer's comments will be taken seriously by the chairman and that the committee should consider their options under existing committee rules to make this information public, depending on how it goes in the next 48 hours. And I would -- I think that the White House should be aware that there is strong interest among many of us to have this be the most open process possible, in fairness to those families who were affected, we heard from this morning, and really in the interest of a democratic society. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. REP. LAHOOD: Mr. Chairman? REP. GOSS: Chairman Graham had to step out for a moment; he'll be back. But I assure you, Ms. Pelosi, that he will be attentive to that request, as will I. Is it a point of inquiry or on this matter? REP. LAHOOD: On this matter. REP. GOSS: Mr. LaHood. REP. LAHOOD: Mr. Chairman, I wonder if the two chairmen could approach the White House within the next 48 hours, since they have this under consideration, to encourage them to make this information public and to relay the will of -- I believe it's the will of the joint committee that, based on what our staff director has said, that this information is important to be released. And it sounds like they're trying to make a political decision. And we would -- the joint committee would encourage them to release the information. I say that because it's under consideration, and I think it's important, particularly given the testimony that was provided by the first two witnesses. Thank you. REP. GOSS: Thank you, Mr. LaHood. I assure you that this is not a matter of first impression for the two chairmen or actually the four of us. We have made this case before. And just so all members of the committee and the public will know, there are approximately generalized areas that we feel there is legitimacy to withhold information to the public. Otherwise we feel the burden is on to the administration to prove to us why we should not give it to the public. We take the position the public deserves it. Those three exceptions are, of course, sources and methods, particularly those still active; plans and intentions -- that would be involving any actions we might take which might put our personnel at harm by giving advance information about what they're up to; and the third area is in the active prosecutions ongoing by the Department of Justice. We don't want to in any way mess up a prosecution that is going forward by saying something inadvertent that would create a problem for the prosecution. I think, other than those three areas, the public has a right to know and a need to know, because part of the reason we're going public hear is the awareness curve of what this enemy looks like, what they can do to us, and why we need to have a better system and why we are going to be asking for the support of our constituency, the American people, to give us a better intelligence system and all that that means. I hope that's a satisfactory answer. And your request is duly noted and will be dealt with. Would you please proceed after I advise the members that we have about 12 minutes left on a vote in the House? Is it one vote or two? Do we know? I believe it is one vote. Do members of the Senate wish to continue? SEN. FEINSTEIN: Mr. Chairman? Mr. Chairman? REP. GOSS: Yes, Senator. SEN. FEINSTEIN: Might I ask a question? Will there be a brief recess over the lunch hour for those of us that have commitments? REP. GOSS: It had been intended that there would not be, and I would suggest that when Senator Graham comes back, that you confer with him on that. The members of the House are now going to vote, and we will be away for about 20 minutes. And perhaps in that time you can decide how you wish to carry forward. SEN. SHELBY: Mr. Chairman, do you want us to wait and suspend the hearing? Because you won't have the benefit of her testimony. REP. GOSS: What is the view of the members? Do you want them to suspend or -- SEN. SHELBY: Till you get back. I think so. SEN. GRAHAM: The hearing will suspend until the members of the House return. (Recess.) SEN. GRAHAM: Call the hearing back to order. Ms. Eleanor Hill was in the early stages of providing us with the report of the joint inquiry staff. For purposes of people's schedules, it is our plan after Ms. Hill completes her statement to them call upon members in the order in which they arrived for five minutes of either questions or comments. I recognize that we will be running through the lunch hour. If members have to leave for previous commitments, or the pangs of hunger become overwhelming, they are encouraged to do so, but also encouraged to return so that they can have their opportunity to ask questions or make their comments. Ms. Hill. MS. HILL: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. SEN. FEINSTEIN: Excuse me. Mr. Chairman, could you read the list so we might know where we are? SEN. GRAHAM: Yes ma'am. The -- after the -- the chairs and vice chairs, they are in this order: Senator DeWine, Congressman Boehlert, Senator Wyden, Congressman Bereuter, Congressman Bishop, Senator Levin, Senator Inhofe, Congressman Peterson, Congressman Cramer, Congressman Boswell, Congressman Castle, Congressman Roemer, Congresswoman Harman, Congressman Burr, Senator Bayh, Senator Rockefeller, Senator Feinstein, Senator Mikulski, Congressman LaHood, Congressman Hoekstra, Senator Edwards, Congressman Gibbons, Congressman Everett. SEN. INHOFE (?): Mr. Chairman? SEN. GRAHAM: Yes. SEN. INHOFE (?): Would it be appropriate to ask unanimous consent of the members that if individuals do have to leave, if they have statements, that they could be included as part of the record. SEN. GRAHAM: It will be included in the record. SEN INHOFE (?): I thank the chair. SEN. GRAHAM: Are there any other comments before we return to Ms. Hill? Ms. Hill. MS. HILL: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Before I forget, I do want to ask that we have two versions of this statement -- it's the same statement but we have two copies, one of which has been signed and certified as releasable, cleared for public release by the chair of the declassification working group for the intelligence community, and each page has been initialed by that individual. And the second copy that I would also like to make available and part of the record is a similar copy that was signed and certified by the representative of the Department of Justice and initialed indicating that they agreed and concurred that it was suitable for public release, because, as you know, the Justice Department has some litigation concerns, ongoing cases. So, I'd ask that those be made part of the record. SEN. GRAHAM: Without objection. MS. HILL: Okay. I appreciate the opportunity to appear here today to advise the committees and the American public on the progress to date of the joint inquiry staff's review of the activities of the U.S. intelligence community in connection with the September 11th terrorist attacks on the United States. As the horror and sheer inhumanity of that day engulfed this nation, all of us struggled with shock, with the utter disbelief, and the inevitable search for answers. The questions, if not the answers, were obvious. How could we have been so surprised? What did our government, especially our intelligence agencies, know before Sept. 11, 2001? Why didn't they know more? What can we do to strengthen and improve the capabilities of our intelligence agencies and as a result help save ourselves and our children from ever having to face this again? On Feb. 14, 2002, the leadership of these two committees announced their resolve to come together to find credible answers to those sobering but critically important questions. The committees joined in an unprecedented, bicameral and bipartisan joint inquiry effort to meet that challenge. To conduct the review, the committees assembled a single staff that we call the joint inquiry staff, of 24 highly skilled professionals with experience in such areas as intelligence collection, analysis, management, law enforcement, investigations, and oversight. My testimony this morning is intended to address the inquiry's initial task, which was to conduct a factual review of what the intelligence community knew, or should have known, prior to Sept. 11, 2001, regarding the international terrorist threat to the United States. I caution that the inquiry remains a work in progress, and that we may be developing additional relevant information as our work continues. That being said, we feel it is important to share with the American people, through these hearings, what we have found through our efforts to date. Let me briefly describe the way in which we have approached this review. We decided to target our search on categories of information that would most likely yield any intelligence material of relevance to the Sept. 11 attacks. Specifically, our teams requested and reviewed from the intelligence community agencies these categories of information: any information obtained before Sept. 11 suggesting that an attack on the United States was imminent and what was done with it; any information obtained before Sept. 11 that should have alerted the intelligence community to this kind of attack, that is, using airplanes to attack buildings, and what was done with it; any information obtained before Sept.r 11 about the 19 dead hijackers and what was done with it; and any information obtained after Sept. 11 about the hijackers and their backgrounds, including their involvement with al Qaeda, entry into this country, and activities while in this country, as well as why they never came to the attention of the United States government. And I would point out on the issue of the hijackers that we do intend _ we will not address that this morning, but we do intend to have an additional statement at subsequent hearings that are focused on that issue. As part of its review of the evolution of the international terrorist threat against the United States, the joint inquiry staff produced a chronology that began in 1982 and ends on Sept. 11, 2001, and that chronology, I believe, has been reproduced and handed out, and is also depicted on these charts here in the room this morning. And I would request that the chronology also be made part of the record. SEN. GRAHAM: Without objection, so ordered. MS. HILL: The chronology notes significant events in international terrorism, significant counterterrorist actions that were taken by the U.S. government in response to the threat, and information received by the intelligence community that was potentially relevant to the Sept. 11 attacks. The chronology underscores several points regarding with the U.S. government, specifically the intelligence community, knew about the international terrorist threat to the United States and U.S. interests prior to Sept. 11, 2001, and these are those points. Sept. 11, while indelible in magnitude and in impact, was by no means America's first confrontation with international terrorism. While the nature of the threat has evolved and changed over time, it has long been recognized that United States interests were considered prime targets by various international terrorist groups. In response to a number of terrorist attacks on U.S. interests abroad during the 1980's, the U.S. government initiated a focused effort on terrorism _ against terrorism _ including the establishment by the director of central intelligence, William Casey, of the Counter-Terrorism Center, or C.T.C., at C.I.A. headquarters in 1986. In 1996, 10 years later, the F.B.I. created its own counter-terrorism center at F.B.I. headquarters. Both in terms of attempts and actual attacks, there was considerable historical evidence prior to Sept. 11 that international terrorists had planned, and were in fact capable of conducting major terrorist strikes within the United States. The 1993 attack on the World Trade Center, the subsequent discovery in 1993 of plots to bomb New York City landmarks, and the arrest in 1999, during the millennium, of an individual with al Qaeda connections intending to bomb Los Angeles International Airport should have erased any doubts, to the extent they existed, about that point. From 1994 through as late as August 2001, the intelligence community had received information indicating that international terrorists had seriously considered the use of airplanes as a means of carrying out terrorist attacks. While this method of attack had clearly been discussed in terrorist circles, there was apparently little, if any effort, by intelligence community analysts to produce any strategic assessments of terrorists using aircraft as weapons. Osama Bin Laden's role in international terrorism came to the attention of the intelligence community in the early 1990s. While bin Laden was initially viewed as a financier of terrorism, by 1996, the intelligence community was aware of his involvement in directing terrorist acts and had begun actively collecting intelligence on him. Bin Laden's own words indicated a steadily escalating threat. In August 1996, Osama Bin Laden issued a public fatwah or religious decree authorizing attacks on Western military targets in the Arabian Peninsula. In February 1998, bin Laden issued another public fatwah authorizing and promoting attacks on U.S. civilians and military personnel anywhere in the world. Following the August 1998 bombings of two U.S. embassies in East Africa, intelligence community leadership recognized how dangerous bin Laden's network was. In December 1998, director of central intelligence, George Tenet, provided written guidance to his deputies at the C.I.A., declaring, in effect, a, quote, war with bin Laden. While counterterrorism was a resource priority from the time of the D.C.I.'s statement onward, it was competing with several other intelligence priorities, such as nonproliferation. Despite the D.C.I.'s declaration of war in 1998, there was no massive shift in budget or reassignment of personnel to counter-terrorism until after Sept. 11, 2001. By late 1998, the intelligence community had amassed a growing body of information _ though general in nature, and lacking specific details on time and on place _ indicating that bin Laden and the al Qaeda network intended to strike within the United States, and concern about bin Laden continued to grow over time and reached peak levels in the spring and summer of 2001, as the intelligence community faced increasing numbers of reports of imminent al Qaeda attacks against U.S. interests. In July and August 2001, that rise in intelligence reporting began to decrease, just as three additional developments occurred in the United States: the Phoenix memo, the detention of Zacarias Moussaoui, and the intelligence community's realization that two individuals with ties to bin Laden's network, Khalid Al-Midhar and Nawaq Alhamzi, were possibly in the United States. The two individuals turned out to be two of the 19 hijackers on Sept. 11. The intelligence community apparently had not connected these individual warning flags to each other, to the drumbeat of threat reporting that had just occurred, or to the urgency of the war effort against bin Laden. Our review today provides further context for each of these points, and my written statement addresses in great detail each point. For purposes of this review, I am going to focus not on the historical sections but rather on our review of more recent intelligence reporting. And the first point in that regard would be intelligence reporting on bin Laden's intentions to strike inside the United States. Central to the September 11th plot was Osama Bin Laden's idea of carrying out a terrorist operation within the United States. It has been suggested that prior to Sept.r 11, 2001, information available to the intelligence community had for the most part pointed to a terrorist threat against U.S. interests abroad. Our review confirmed that shortly after Osama Bin Laden's May 1998 press conference, the intelligence community began to acquire intelligence information indicating that bin Laden's network intended to strike within the United States. These intelligence reports, which I'll go through in a minute, should be understood in their proper context. First, they generally did not contain specific information as to where, when and how a terrorist attack might occur, and generally they are not corroborated by further information. Second, these reports represented a small percentage of the threat information that the intelligence community obtained during this period, most of which pointed to the possibility of attacks against U.S. interest overseas. Nonetheless, there was a modest but relatively steady stream of intelligence information indicating the possibility of terrorist attacks within the United States. Third, the credibility of the sources providing this information was sometimes questionable. While one could not as a result give too much credence to some individual reports, the totality of the information in the body of reporting clearly reiterated a consistent and critically important theme _ bin Laden's intent to launch terrorist attacks inside the United States. And I will summarize several of these reports _ and I should stress again, these are in declassified versions, they have been declassified. In June 1998, the intelligence community obtained information from several sources that bin Laden was considering attacks in the United States, including Washington, D.C. and New York. This information was provided to senior U.S. government officials in July 1998. In August 1998, the intelligence community obtained information that a group of unidentified Arabs planned to fly an explosive-laden plane from a foreign country into the World Trade Center. The information was passed to the F.B.I. and the F.A.A. The F.A.A. found the plot highly unlikely given the state of that foreign country's aviation program. Moreover, they believed that a flight originating outside the United States would be detected before it reached its intended target inside the United States. The F.B.I.'s New York office took no action on the information, filing the communication in the office's bombing repository file. The intelligence community has acquired additional information since then indicating there may be links between this group and other terrorist groups, including al Qaeda. In September 1998, the intelligence community prepared a memorandum detailing al Qaeda infrastructure in the United States, including the use of fronts for terrorist activities. This information was provided to senior U.S. government officials in September of 1998. In September of 1998, the intelligence community obtained information that bin Laden's next operation would possibly involve flying an aircraft loaded with explosives into a U.S. airport and detonating it. This information was provided to senior U.S. government officials in late 1998. In October 1998, the intelligence community obtained information that al Qaeda was trying to establish and operative cell within the United States. This information indicated there might be an effort underway to recruit U.S. citizen Islamists and U.S.-based expatriates from the Middle East and North Africa. In the fall of 1998, the intelligence community received information concerning a bin Laden plot involving aircraft in the New York and Washington, D.C. areas. In November 1998, the intelligence community obtained information that a bin Laden terrorist cell was attempting to recruit a group of five to seven young men from the United States to travel to the Middle East for training. This was in conjunction with planning to strike U.S. domestic targets. In November of 1998, the intelligence community received information that bin Laden and senior associates had agreed to allocate reward money for the assassinations of four top intelligence agency officers. The bounty for each assassination was $9 million. The bounty was in response to the U.S. announcement of an increase in the reward money for information leading to the arrest of bin Laden. In the spring of 1999, the intelligence community obtained information about a planned bin Laden attack on a U.S. government facility in Washington, D.C. In August 1999, the intelligence community obtained information that bin Laden's organization had decided to target the secretary of state, the secretary of defense and the director of central intelligence. ``Target"" was interpreted by intelligence community analysts to mean assassinate. In September 1999 the intelligence community obtained information that bin Laden and others were planning a terrorist act in the United States, possibly against specific landmarks in California and New York City. The reliability of the source of this information was unknown. In late 1999 the intelligence community obtained information regarding the bin Laden network's possible plans to attack targets in Washington, D.C. and New York City during the millennium celebration. On Dec. 14, 1999. an individual named Ahmed Ressam was arrested as he attempted to enter the United States from Canada. An alert U.S. Customs Service officer in Fort Washington stopped Ressam and asked to search his vehicle. Chemicals and detonator materials were found in his car. Ressam's intended target was Los Angeles International Airport. In February 2000 the intelligence community obtained information that bin Laden was making plans to assassinate U.S. intelligence officials, including the director of the F.B.I. In March 2000 the intelligence community obtained information regarding the types of targets that operatives in bin Laden's network might strike. The Statue of Liberty was specifically mentioned, as were skyscrapers, ports, airports, and nuclear power plants. In March 2000 the intelligence community obtained information indicating bin Laden was planning attacks in specific West Coast areas, possibly involving the assassination of several public officials. The intelligence community had concerns that this information might have come from a source known to fabricate information. And in April 20001 the intelligence community obtained information from a source with terrorist connections, who speculated that bin Laden would be interested in commercial pilots as potential terrorists. The source warned that the United States should not focus only on embassy bombings, that terrorists sought ``spectacular and traumatic"" attacks and that the first World Trade Center bombing would be the type of attack that would be appealing. The source did not mention a timeframe for any attack. Because the source was offering personal speculation and not hard information, the information was not disseminated within the intelligence community. Bin Laden's declaration of war in 1998 and intelligence reports indicating possible terrorist plots inside the United States did not go unnoticed by the intelligence community, which, in turn, advised senior officials in the U.S. government of the serious nature of the threat. The staff has also reviewed documents other than individual intelligence reports that demonstrate that at least at senior levels the intelligence community understood that bin Laden posed a serious threat to the domestic United States. Here are five examples: A Dec. 1, 1998 intelligence community assessment of Osama bin Laden read in part, and I quote, ``UBL is actively planning against U.S. targets. Multiple reports indicate UBL is keenly interested in striking the U.S. on its own soil. Al-Qaeda is recruiting operatives for attacks in the U.S. but has not yet identified potential targets."" On Dec. 4, 1998, in a memorandum to his deputies at the C.I.A. the director of central intelligence summed up the situation in this way, ``We must now enter a new phased in our effort against bin Laden. Our work to date has been remarkable and in some instances heroic, yet each day we all acknowledge that retaliation is inevitable and that its scope may be far larger than we have previously experienced. We are at war. I want no resources or people spared in this effort either inside C.I.A. or the community."" A classified document signed by a senior U.S. government official in December 1998 read in part, ``The intelligence community has strong indications that bin Laden intends to conduct or sponsor attacks inside the United States."" In June 1999 testimony before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and in a July 1999 briefing to House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence staffers, the chief of the C.T.C. described reports that bin Laden and his associates were planning attacks in the United States. And a classified document signed by a senior U.S. government official in July 1999 characterized bin Laden's February 1998 statement as, ``a de facto declaration of war,"" on the United States. What is left clear is the extent to which other parts of the government, as well as the American people, understood and fully appreciated the gravity and the immediacy of the threat. For example, officials at the National Security Agency, whom we have interviewed, were aware of D.C.I. Tenet's December 1998 declaration that the intelligence community was at war with bin Laden. On the other hand, relatively few of the F.B.I. agents interviewed by the Joint Inquiry Staff seem to have been aware of D.C.I. Tenet's declaration. There was also considerable variation in the degree to which F.B.I.-led Joint Terrorism Task Forces or J.T.T.F. prioritized and coordinated field efforts targeting bin Laden and al-Qaeda. While the F.B.I.'s New York office was the lead office in the vast majority of counterterrorism investigations concerning bin Laden, many other F.B.I. offices around the country were unaware of the magnitude of the threat. There are also indications that the allocation of intelligence community resources after the D.C.I.'s December 1998 declaration did not adequately reflect a true war effort against bin Laden. In 1999 the CTC had only three analysts assigned full time to bin Laden's terrorist network worldwide. After 2000 but before Sept. 11, 2001, that number had risen to five. On a broader scale, our review has found little evidence prior to Sept. 11 of a sustained national effort to mobilize public awareness and to harden the homeland against a potential assault by bin Laden within the United States, with the possible exception of a heightened focus on weapons of mass destruction. The second point that I want to cover is strategic warnings, indications of a possible terrorist attack in the spring and summer of 2001. Let me briefly describe what we have found regarding the level and the nature of threat information that was obtained by the intelligence community during the spring and summer of 2001. During that time period the community experienced a significant rise in information indicating that bin Laden and al-Qaeda intended to strike against United States interests in the very near future. Some individuals within the community have suggested that the increase in threat reporting was unprecedented, at least in terms of their own experience. While the reporting repeatedly predicted dire consequences for Americans, it did not provide actionable detail on when, where and how specific attacks would occur. Between late March and September 2001 the intelligence community detected numerous indicators of an impending terrorist attack, some of which pointed specifically to the United States as a possible target. In March 2001 an intelligence source claimed a group of bin Laden operatives were planning to conduct an unspecified attack in the United States in April 2001. One of the operatives allegedly resided within the United States. In April 2001 the intelligence community obtained information that unspecified terrorist operatives in California and New York State were planning a terrorist attack in those states for April. Between May and July the National Security Agency reported at least 33 communications indicating a possible imminent terrorist attack. None of these reports provided any specific information on where, when or how an attack might occur, nor was it clear that any of the individuals involved in these intercepted communications had any firsthand knowledge of where, when or how an attack might occur. If they did know, it was not evident in the intercept. These reports were widely disseminated within the intelligence community. In May 2001 the intelligence community obtained information that supporters of bin Laden were reportedly planning to infiltrate the United States via Canada in order to carryout a terrorist operation using high explosives. The report mentioned an attack within the United States though it did not say where in the U.S. or when or how an attack might occur. In July 2001 this information was shared with the F.B.I., the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the U.S. Customs Service and the State Department and was included in a closely held intelligence report for senior government officials in August 2001. In May 2001 the Department of Defense acquired and shared with other elements of the intelligence community information indicating that seven individuals associated with bin Laden had departed various locations for Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States. In June 2001, the D.C.I.'s C.T.C. had information that key operatives in Osama bin Laden's organization were disappearing while others were preparing for martyrdom. In July 2001 the D.C.I.'s C.T.C. was aware of an individual who had recently been in Afghanistan, who had reported, ``everyone is talking about an impending attack."" The intelligence community was also aware that bin Laden had stepped up his propaganda efforts in the preceding months. On Aug. 16, 2001, in Minneapolis, Minn. the INS detained Zacarias Moussaoui. Prior to that date, in August 2001 Mr. Moussaoui's conduct had aroused suspicions about why he was learning to fly large commercial aircraft and had prompted the flight school he was attending in Minneapolis to contact the local F.B.I. office. FBI agents believed that Moussaoui may have been intending to carry out a terrorist act. On Aug. 23, 2001, the intelligence community requested that two individuals, Khalid al-Midhar and Nawaf Alhazmi, who had first come to the attention of the community in 1999 as possible associates of bin Laden's terrorist network, be added to the U.S. Department of State's watch list for denying visas to individuals attempting to enter the United States. Working levels of I.N.S. and U.S. Customs had determined that at least one of them was likely in the United States, prompting F.B.I. headquarters to request searches for them in both New York and Los Angeles. The F.B.I.'s New York field office unsuccessfully searched for al- Midhar and Alhazmi. The F.B.I.'s Los Angeles office received the search request on Sept. 11, 2001. In late summer 2001 the intelligence community obtained information that an individual associated with al-Qaeda was considering mounting terrorist operations within the United States. There was no information available as to the timing of possible attacks or the alleged targets. And on Sept.r 10, 2001, the N.S.A. intercepted two communications between individuals abroad suggesting imminent terrorist activity. These communications were not translated into English and disseminated until Sept. 12, 2001. These intercepts did not provide any indication of where or what activities might occur. Despite these indicators of a possible terrorist attack inside the United States, during the course of interviews the joint inquiry staff was told that it was the general view of the U.S. intelligence community in the spring and summer of 2001 that an attack on U.S. interests was more likely to occur overseas. Individuals in the intelligence community pointed to intelligence information, the arrest of suspected terrorists in the Middle East and Europe, and a credible report of a plan to attack a U.S. Embassy in the Middle East as factors that shaped their thinking about where an attack was likely to occur. One senior F.B.I. official said that based on the intelligence he was seeing, he thought there was a high probability, ``98 percent,"" that the attack would occur overseas. During the summer of 2001, the intelligence community was also disseminating information through appropriate channels to senior U.S. government officials about possible terrorist attacks. For example, in June 2001, the community issued a terrorist threat advisory, warning U.S. government agencies that there was a high probability of an imminent terrorist attack against U.S. interests by Sunni extremists associated with bin Laden's al Qaeda organization. The advisory mentioned the Arabian peninsula, Israel and Italy as possible locations. According to the advisory, the community continued to believe that Sunni extremists associated with al Qaeda are most likely to attempt spectacular attacks, resulting in numerous casualties. Subsequently, intelligence information provided to senior government leaders indicated that bin Laden's organization expected near-term attacks to have dramatic consequences on government or cause major casualties. A briefing prepared for senior government officials at the beginning of July 2001 contained the following language: ``Based on a review of all source reporting over the last five months, we believe that UBL will launch a significant terrorist attack against U.S. and/or Israeli interests in the coming weeks. The attack will be spectacular and designed to inflict mass casualties against U.S. facilities or interests. Attack preparations have been made. Attack will occur with little or no warning."" Later, intelligence information provided to senior government leaders indicated that bin Laden's organization continued to expect imminent attacks on U.S. interests. The joint inquiry staff has been advised by a representative of the intelligence community that about a month later, in August 2001, a closely held intelligence report, for senior government officials, included information that bin Laden had wanted to conduct attacks in the United States since 1997. The information included discussion of the arrest of Ahmed Ressam in December 1999, and the 1998 bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. It mentioned that members of al Qaeda, including some U.S. citizens, had resided or traveled in or traveled to the United States for years, and that the group apparently maintained a support structure here. The report cited uncorroborated information obtained in 1998 that bin Laden wanted to hijack airplanes to gain the release of U.S.-held extremists. F.B.I. judgments about patterns of activity, consistent with preparation of hijackings or other types of attacks, and the number of bin Laden number of investigations underway, as well as information acquired in May 2001 that indicated a group of bin Laden's supporters was planning attacks in the United States with explosives. In August 2001, based on information it had in its possession at the time, the C.I.A. sent a message to the F.A.A., asking the F.A.A. to advise corporate security directors of U.S. air carriers of the following information: ``A group of six Pakistanis currently based in Bolivia may be planning to conduct a hijacking, or possibly a bombing, or an act of sabotage against at commercial airliner. While we have no details of the carrier, the date or the location of this or these possibly actions, we have learned the group has had discussions in which Canada, England, Malaysia, Cuba, South Africa, Mexico, Atlanta, New York, Madrid, Moscow and Dubai have come up, and India and Islamabad have been described as possible travel destinations."" While this information was not related to an attack planned by al Qaeda, it did alert the aviation community to the possibility that a hijacking plot might occur in the U.S. shortly before the Sept. 11 attacks occurred. Now I want to turn to intelligence information on possible terrorist use of airplanes as weapons. Central to the Sept. 11 attack was the terrorist use of airplanes as weapons. In the aftermath of the attacks, there was much discussion about the extent to which our government was or could have been aware of the threat of terrorist attacks of this type, and the extent to which adequate precautions were taken to address the threat. Based on our review to date, we believe that the intelligence community was aware of the potential for this type of terrorist attack, but did not produce any specific assessments of the likelihood that terrorists would use airplanes as weapons. Our review has uncovered several examples of intelligence reporting on the possible use of airplanes as weapons in terrorist operations. In December 1994, Algerian Armed Islamic Group terrorists hijacked an Air France flight in Algiers, and threatened to crash it into the Eiffel Tower. French authorities deceived the terrorists into thinking the plane did not have enough fuel to reach Paris, and diverted it. A French antiterrorist force stormed the plane and killed all four terrorists. In January 1995, a Philippine national police raid turned up materials in a Manila apartment indicating that three individuals planned, among other things, to crash a plane into C.I.A. headquarters. The Philippine national police said that the same group was responsible for the bombing of a Philippine airliner on Dec. 12, 1994. Information on the threat was passed to the F.A.A., which briefed U.S. and major foreign carriers. In January 1996, the intelligence community obtained information concerning a planned suicide attack by individuals associated with Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman, and a key al Qaeda operative. The plan was to fly to the United States from Afghanistan, and attack the White House. In October 1996, the intelligence community obtained information regarding an Iranian plot to hijack a Japanese plane over Israel and crash it into Tel Aviv. An individual would board the plane in the Far East. During the flight he would commandeer the aircraft, order it to fly over Tel Aviv, and then crash the plane into the city. In 1997, one of the units at F.B.I. headquarters became concerned about the possibility of a terrorist group using an unmanned aerial vehicle, UAV, for terrorist attack. The F.B.I. and C.I.A. became aware of reporting that this group had purchased a UAV. At the time the agency's view was that the only reason that this group would need a UAV would be for either reconnaissance or attack. There was more concern about the possibility of an attack outside the United States; for example, by flying the UAV into a U.S. Embassy or a visiting U.S. delegation. As noted previously, in August 1998, the intelligence community obtained information that a group of unidentified Arab planned to fly an explosive-laden plane from a foreign country into the World Trade Center. Also noted previously, in September '98, the intelligence community obtained information that bin Laden's next operation could possibly involve flying an aircraft loaded with explosives into a U.S. airport and detonating it. In November 1998, the community obtained information that a Turkish Islamic extremist group had planned a suicide attack to coincide with celebrations marking the death of Ataturk. The conspirators, who were arrested, planned to crash an airplane packed with explosives into Ataturk's tomb during a government ceremony. The Turkish press said the group had cooperated with Osama bin Laden. The F.B.I.'s New York office included this incident in one of its Osama bin Laden databases. In February 1999, the intelligence community obtained information that Iraq had formed a suicide pilot unit it planned to use against British and U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf. The C.I.A. commented that this was highly unlikely, and probably disinformation. In March 1999, the intelligence community obtained information regarding a plan by an al Qaeda member who was a U.S. citizen to fly a hang glider into the Egyptian presidential palace, and then detonate the explosives he was carrying. The individual who received hang glider training in the United States brought the hang glider back to Afghanistan. In April 2000, the intelligence community obtained information regarding an alleged bin Laden plot to hijack a 747. The source, who was a walk-in to the FBI's Newark office, claimed that he had been to a training camp in Pakistan, where he learned hijacking techniques and received arms training. He also stated that he was supposed to meet five to six other individuals in the United States who would also participate in the plot. They were instructed to use all necessary force to take over the plane, because there would be pilots among the hijacking team. The plan was to fly the plane to Afghanistan, and if they could not make it there that they were to blow up the plane. Although the individual passed an F.B.I. polygraph, the F.B.I. was never able to verify any aspect of his story or identify his contacts in the United States. And, in August 2001, the intelligence community obtained information regarding a plot to either bomb the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi from an airplane, or crash an airplane into it. The intelligence community learned that two people who were reportedly acting on instructions from bin Laden met in October 2000 to discuss this plot. Despite these reports, the community did not produce any specific assessments of the likelihood that terrorists would use airplanes as weapons. This may have been driven in part by resource issues in the area of intelligence analysis. Prior to Sept. 11, 2001, the C.T.C. had 40 analysts to analyze terrorism issues worldwide, with only one of the five branches focused on terrorist tactics. Prior to Sept. 11, 2001, the only terrorist tactic on which the CTC performed strategic analysis was the possible use of chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear weapons, because there were more obvious potential for mass casualties. At the F.B.I. prior to Sept. 11, 2001, support for ongoing investigations and operations was favored in terms of resources over long-term strategic analysis. We were told during the course of our F.B.I. interviews that prevention occurred in the operational unit, not through strategic analysis, and that prior to Sept. 11 the F.B.I. had insufficient resources to do both. We were also told that the F.B.I.'s al Qaeda related analytic expertise had been ``gutted"" by transfers to operational units, and that as a result the F.B.I.'s analytic unit had only one individual working on al Qaeda at the time of the Sept. 11 attacks. While focused strategic analysis was lacking, the subject of aviation related terrorism was included in some broader terrorist threat assessments, such as the National Intelligence Estimate on Terrorism. For example, the 1995 NIE on terrorism cited the consideration the Bojinka conspirators gave to attacking CIA headquarters with an aircraft. The document contained the following language: ""Our review of the evidence suggests that the conspirators were guided in the selection of the method and venue of the attack by carefully studying security procedures in place in the region. If terrorists operating in this country, the United States, are similarly methodical, they will identify serious vulnerabilities in the security system for domestic flights."" The 1997 update to that report on terrorism included the following language: ``Civil aviation remains a particularly attractive target, in light of the fear and publicity the downing of an airliner would evoke, and the revelations last summer of the U.S. air transport sector's vulnerabilities. In a December 2000 report, the F.B.I. and the F.A.A. published a classified assessment that suggested less concern about the threat to domestic aviation. ``F.B.I. investigations confirm domestic and international terrorist groups operating within the United States, but do not suggest evidence of plans to target domestic civil aviation. Terrorist activity within the U.S. has focused primarily on fundraising, recruiting new members, and disseminating propaganda. While international terrorists have conducted attacks on U.S. soil, these acts represent anomalies in their traditional targeting, which focused on U.S. interests overseas."" After Sept. 11, 2001, the C.I.A. belatedly acknowledged some of the information that was available and has been available regarding the use of airplanes as weapons. A draft analysis dated Nov.19, 2001, entitled, ``The September 11th Attack: A Preliminary Assessment,"" states, ``We do not know the process by which bin Laden and his lieutenants decided to hijack planes with the idea of flying them into buildings in the United States. But the idea of hijacking planes for suicide attacks had long been current in jihadist circles. For example, GIA terrorists from Algeria had planned to crash an Air France jet into the Eiffel Tower in December 1994. And Ramzi Yousef, a participant in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, planned to explode 12 U.S. jet airliners, jetliners, in midair over the Pacific in the mid 1990's. Likewise, the World Trade Center had long been a target of terrorist bombers."" Despite the intelligence available in recent years, our review to date has found no indication that prior to September 11th, analysts from the intelligence community were cataloguing information regarding the use of airplanes as weapons as a terrorist tactic, sending requirements to collectors to look for additional information on this threat, or considering the likelihood that Osama bin Laden, al Qaeda or any other terrorist group would attack the United States or U.S. interests in these ways -- in this way. Mr. Chairman, our purpose this morning was to report on the information that the intelligence community possessed prior to September 11th, 2001 about terrorist attacks of the kind America witnessed on that fateful day. In closing, let me just say that for all of us who have been conducting this review, the task has been and continues to be not only a daunting one but, in all respects, a sobering one. We are ever mindful that lost lives and shattered families were the catalyst for this inquiry. We know, as I have heard Ms. Pelosi say many times, that we are on sacred ground. We also have come to know, from our review of the intelligence reporting, the depth and the intensity of the enemy's hatred for this country and the relentless zeal with which it targeted American lives. We understand not only the importance but also the enormity of the task facing the intelligence community. As my statement this morning suggests, the community made mistakes prior to September 11th, and the problems that led to thosemistakes need to be addressed and they need to be fixed. On the other hand, the vengeance and the inhumanity that we saw on that day were not mistakes for Osama bin Laden and for others like him. The responsibility for September 11th remains squarely on the shoulders of the terrorists who planned and participated in the attacks. Their fervor and their cruelty may be incomprehensible, but it is real. It persists, and it is directed at Americans. We are convinced that it is no longer a question of whether the intelligence community can do better. It must do better. America can afford no less. Mr. Chairman, that concludes my statement this morning. Thank you. SEN. GRAHAM: Ms. Hill, I would like to extend my congratulations to you and the staff for an excellent, sobering assessment of the events prior to September the 11th. I recognize this is the first of what will be a series of publicly-released statements of the results of our inquiry to date, and we look forward to your future reports. MS. HILL: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. SEN. GRAHAM: We will now proceed to questions and comments from members, starting with Senator DeWine. Let me just state who the next questioners will be: Mr. Boehlert, Senator Wyden, Mr. Bereuter, Mr. Bishop, Senator Levin, Senator Inhofe, Mr. Peterson, Mr. Cramer. SEN. MIKE DEWINE (R-OH): Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. Ms. Hill, thank you for your very good statement and your good work. MS. HILL: Thank you, Senator. SEN. DEWINE: Mr. Chairman, thank you for the opportunity to make some brief remarks at this very important public hearing. Let me also thank our witnesses who testified this morning. While none of us can really understand what we've been through, I have seen how tragic the events of September 11th have been for my own state director, a very good friend of mine, Barbara Skenk (sp). Barbara lost her husband, Doug Cherry (sp), to the terrorist attacks. Before talking about what I hope comes out of these hearings, let me express a concern. I've been concerned from the outset of this investigation that the timed deadlines under which this committee is operating would not be conducive to producing the product that we want. The artificial deadline, I believe, is making it extremely difficult to get the job done. It's simply a lack of time. It's a lack of resources. However, Mr. Chairman, there still are things that we can accomplish, even with the current constraints of this investigation. First, it is important to report -- and we've begun this today -- it's important to report to the American people what intelligence failures did occur, not so we can assess blame but so we can learn from the specific mistakes that were made. But there is more to it than that. Yes, we need to gather the facts and take time to examine what they mean with regard to what happened on September 11th. But we certainly cannot stop there. We also need to figure out what these facts tell us about the current structure of our overall intelligence community. What are the shortcomings? Where do we need reform? Now, I felt Mr. Push's testimony earlier was very excellent. I thought he talked about some of the big-picture issues that we're not going to resolve on this committee, but at least we can begin to look at and begin that national dialogue about these issues. So I thought his testimony was particularly telling. I think, for example, Mr. Chairman, in investigating these issues, we must take a serious look at the role of the director of Central Intelligence. I believe it's time to give the DCI the necessary authority and ability to truly direct our overall intelligence operations. Quite simply, we need to empower the DCI to do the job. I believe we also must seriously examine the long-term resource issues that confront us, not just now but over the long haul, over the next decade or two decades. Do we have the human resources available within the agencies themselves? Do we have the right technology and enough of it to get the job done in the new world that we live in? Do we have a long-term commitment to intelligence? I think we need to discuss that commitment and what we are looking at and make it very plain to the American people the sacrifices that are going to have to be made if that intelligence community is to do its job and what kind of resources they need. And finally, I believe that we need to re-examine the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act with the FISA statute and determine what changes are needed to make sure we are getting the intelligence resources to help prevent future attacks. FISA deserves and requires a great deal of attention and oversight from the joint committee, from the Senate and House Intelligence Committees, and frankly from the entire Congress. We must focus our congressional duty for oversight, as we simply have not had, in my opinion, effective oversight since FISA was instituted approximately a quarter of a century ago. Somehow we've got to figure out, Mr. Chairman, how to do that. Finally, this committee's job, I believe, is really to kick off, to launch, a serious national debate about what changes must be made in our intelligence community, because if we've learned anything from September 11th, it is that our security, our safety, the safety of our loved ones, is intrinsically linked to the quality of that intelligence. I thank the chair. SEN. GRAHAM: Thank you, Senator. Congressman Boehlert. REP. SHERWOOD BOEHLERT (R-NY): Mr. Chairman, let me ask a procedure. Are we just to have an opening statement or to go right to questions? SEN. GRAHAM: It is your choice. You have five minutes for either questions or discussion. REP. BOEHLERT: I thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Ms. Hill, let me thank you for an excellent presentation. Let me begin where you ended. You said, ""We are convinced that it is no longer a question of whether the intelligence community can do better. It must do better. America can afford no less."" I could not agree more with that statement. Your summation of our 10 closed hearings and the revelation of information in the public domain is somewhat difficult to deal with, because so much of what we've had, obviously, during those closed hearings has been highly classified, dealing with sensitive national- security information. But it appears to me that the alarm was sounded not once but several times, but too many gave it a deaf ear. I'm not ascribing any sinister motives. I'm just saying too many were not paying attention. There are a lot of reasons for that -- resource deficiencies, lack of adequate staff. Some of the revelations in your testimony are just absolutely mind-boggling. But let me ask something. Back in '98, when the director of Central Intelligence declared war on al Qaeda, sent a memorandum to his agency people. Was it a unilateral declaration of war? Was that memorandum shared with anyone but the in-house people at CIA? Did it go to the FBI? Did it go to all the other agencies in the intelligence community? MS. HILL: We have been following that question in the course of our interviews, and we've been basically -- we're dealing with a lot of the agencies in the intelligence community. We're trying to find out how much the entire community was aware of that declaration of war. And what we're finding is some people were, I think, close; certainly senior levels in the CIA were, and probably in the CIA. But as I mentioned, if you go out to the field offices of the FBI, they were not aware of it. Other people in the federal government were not aware of it. The Defense Department people -- we've interviewed some people there who were not aware of it who might have been interfacing with the community. So I would say it appears to be it was the DCI's decision. It was circulated to some people, but certainly not broadly within the community. And what I find disturbing about it is that it was at senior levels, but sometimes the operative level, the level in the field is where it actually is critical that they know what the priorities should be and have to be, particularly when it's something like combating something like al Qaeda. The field offices of the FBI, in terms of domestic activity, are crucial, because they are the ones who are going to be in the front lines in the United States dealing with those kinds of groups. And, at least in that respect, what we're finding is that many of them were not aware of that declaration of war, and some of them really were not focused very much at all on al Qaeda and bin Laden. REP. BOEHLERT: Well, I find that incomprehensible, quite frankly, because a key operative in our intelligence community, a leader, issued something as important as a declaration of war against an organization that has openly declared its determined effort, the fatwah, the religious decree, to destroy America and Americans. And that information is not shared at the highest level down to the lowest level, which brings me forward to the Phoenix memo and the Minneapolis case involving Mr. Moussaoui. And I've checked with counsel to see if it's all right to reveal some of this stuff, because the problem is I have difficulty, and I've had it for all the years I've served on the committee, in recalling where I learned the information I have. Was it from a highly secure, highly sensitive briefing, or did I read it in the front page of the newspaper? And so my practice has been to just not talk to the media at all about this very important assignment. Then we go forward to the Phoenix memo, which was sent up to headquarters, at a time we had a declaration of war in the intelligence community, and the memo was marked ""routine."" MS. HILL: Well, and it was not only at the time of the declaration of war; it was in the summer of 2001. It was at a time when the threat level was very high also. REP. BOEHLERT: And so the memo was marked ""routine,"" and it was given the most routine handling and never got above mid-level. And then we go out to Minneapolis and the Moussaoui case, and that was treated in a somewhat cavalier, very routine manner. I fail to see how, with all the alarms that were sounded -- well, we know there was not the proper coordination. There was not the proper information-sharing. You have indicated some corrective action has been taken -- oh, my God, we'd only hope so -- since September 11th. But I would suggest a lot of corrective action should have been taken well before September 11th. Let me ask you this. With our first two witnesses, Ms. Breitweiser and Mr. Push -- and their testimony was very poignant -- SEN. GRAHAM: Your time has expired. REP. BOEHLERT: That's a fast five minutes. Just let me finish the one question; I'm in the middle of it. SEN. GRAHAM: We'll be compassionate. REP. BOEHLERT: Did you spend an extended amount of time with both of these witnesses? Because they both have statements that are forever seared in our souls. Some deal with opinion. Others deal with alleged facts. And so did you spend a good amount of time with them? And have you checked up on the alleged facts that they presented? And I'm not questioning those facts; I just want to make sure we're dealing with the same information. MS. HILL: I have met with Ms. Breitweiser several times, since I joined this effort with the committee, with her and her group. And Mr. Push, I believe I've met with him once. I have not checked up on all the specifics in their statement because I didn't see their statements till -- we got those statements yesterday. But I've had a lot of discussions with them. And some of the things, you know, that they mentioned, I'm aware of. Some of them I'd want to look into in more detail, obviously. REP. BOEHLERT: Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your indulgence. SEN. GRAHAM: Thank you. Senator Wyden. SEN. RON WYDEN (R-OR): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ms. Hill, as you know, there were years of history indicating that airplanes would be used as a tool of terrorism. And yet you state on page 30 -- and I'll quote here -- ""Our review to date has found no indications that prior to September 11th analysts in the intelligence community were cataloguing information regarding the use of airplanes as weapons as a terrorist tactic, sending requirements to collectors to look for additional information on this threat, or considering the likelihood that bin Laden, al Qaeda or other terrorist groups would attack the United States or U.S. interests in this way."" That is a remarkable statement, given the history going back I believe to 1994 at least. And my question to begin with is when you ask the intelligence community why this was the case, why they didn't catalogue this information regarding the use of planes as weapons or consider the likelihood that they would be used as terrorist tools, what was the response of the intelligence community when you asked them why? MS. HILL: Well, I think a couple things. They would probably say to that question, and we've spoken to many people over there and gotten opinions and reactions on this, you have to understand the reason we have been able to catalogue all these instances is because one of the things we did was ask the community to go back and find anything that related to aircraft as weapons. So we went back and consolidated and went through their databases to pull it all out so you could see it all together. And I don't believe that had been done before we focused on it, given September 11th. So, one, it's not been all pulled together for them to see it other than piecemeal over time. Secondly, I think what they will tell you on almost many of these things in the terrorism field is that they were overwhelmed. The people who were looking at al-Qaeda and bin Laden will complain to you about resources, about the amount of information that was coming in. They were overwhelmed by almost a flood of information. Because as you can see from our statement there's a lot of reporting in there just on these topics. And, of course that reporting is but a small amount of the overall amount of reporting that the community deals with. So I think the reason they would give you that they had not done that was that it was spread out over time, they were overwhelmed by resources and other priorities and they were overwhelmed by the amount of information they were getting and dealing with the responses to other areas. SEN. WYDEN: What is so hard to swallow, however, is how anything could be a higher priority than this. And for you to state that the intelligence community was not considering the likelihood that bin Laden, al-Qaeda would attack the United States in this way is, of course exactly the kind of thing we've got to address in this inquiry. In your testimony and also from the victims' families we have heard about the failure to place Khalid al-Midhar and Nawaf Alhazmi -- and by the way Mr. Alhazmi is listed in the phone book in San Diego, I gather -- MS. HILL: I'm aware of that. SEN. WYDEN: -- on a watch list that would have prevented their entry into the United States. I offered an amendment on the intelligence bill this year to create a terrorist tracking system that would help ensure that this information would finally actually get shared to everybody in the intelligence area, everybody in the law enforcement area and would actually get to local law enforcement officials. In your view, to make this kind of system effective, what sort of policies need to be included so that finally we can respond to what Mr. Push has asked for, and that is to have a system that on an ongoing basis makes this a top priority, tracking the most dangerous individuals who threaten this country? MS. HILL: Well, I think part of it is you have to get people's attention. I mean, you have to get people focused on the need to do that, people in the system, in the agencies and in the groups that are working on those issues. I mean, in this case, and we're going to go into that particular case in much more detail when we present our testimony or our statement on the hijackers that would relate to the case you're talking about, so we will go into it in a lot more detail and tell you what we've heard from people who were handling that information at the time and why it slipped by them. But I think part of what you will hear again was you may hear things, everything from they had too many things to do, it wasn't considered that significant, they were overwhelmed and it was simply a mistake, they made a mistake. SEN. WYDEN: Mr. Chairman, my time has expired. I would only want to add one last point with respect to where I think we are in terms of our inquiry. As we all know, there are many both on this committee and off who think that essentially this committee ought to punt to an independent effort. I'm of the view that the bar is very, very high now in terms of establishing the credibility of this effort and to show that we're capable of attacking these fundamental problems. This is not something that's going to be solved by just moving the boxes around on the organizational charts and people going up with pointers and saying the problem is solved. So I think Ms. Hill has helped us with the families to get off to a good start and I look forward to working with my colleagues. SEN. GRAHAM: Thank you very much, Senator. Mr. Bishop. REP. BISHOP: Thank you. This is indeed an historic occasion when the two intelligence committees are working together on a matter of great importance like this comes to pass. And I'm sure, however, that given the nature and the circumstances, which require our attention, the destructive attacks on our country September 11th, it's a task, which all of us wish that we didn't have to face. But we're most appreciative today for the well-prepared, thoughtful and helpful testimony presented by Ms. Breitweiser and Mr. Push. We have a responsibility to thoroughly and professionally gather, assess and present the facts about September 11th as they relate to the performance of the intelligence agencies. And as we enter these public hearings there remains a general sense of disappointment and disbelief within the American people that those agencies, particularly the CIA and the FBI, were not better positioned to detect the conspiracy and to prevent the attacks. We must try to address the many questions, which have arisen about why better intelligence was not collected, why better use was not made of the information, which was available, and now publicly examining the performance of the community and the decisions that were made in the Executive Branch and perhaps in Congress about the establishment of priorities within the intelligence community. We will be conducting the type of oversight, which these committees are at present uniquely situated to provide. It is my continued hope that these hearings and our final report will result in a marked improvement in our understanding of the events that led up to 9/11 and most importantly in our ability to protect the American people from terrorist attacks such as these. I look forward to working with the joint leadership and all of our scheduled witnesses, and I want to thank Ms. Hill and her staff for the tremendous work that they have done under very, very difficult circumstances with some muzzling and bridling and limitations and with great time constraints. It has, I think, been a valiant effort and we will certainly as a committee work with you to try to secure the cooperation that you need from the Executive Branch and the agencies in getting access and being able to explain to the American people and have this committee explain to the American people in the kind of detail, which does not compromise forces and methods, plans and intentions or active or ongoing prosecutions so that they can understand as well as we hope to understand what happened, why it happened and what we can do to make sure it does not happen again. With that, I have no questions, but I did want to share those comments and thank again the witnesses for taking the time and the effort, which must have been extremely difficult, given the exigencies of your lives over the past year to have come forward and done the magnificent job that you did today. SEN. GRAHAM: Thank you, Mr. Bishop. Our next questioner or discussant will be Senator Levin. After Senator Levin, Mr. Boswell, Mr. Castle, Mr. Roemer, Ms. Harman, Mr. Burr, Senator Bayh and Senator Rockefeller. Senator Levin. SEN. LEVIN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and first let me thank you, Ms. Hill and your staff for getting us to the point where we are finally analyzing and presenting to the American people the significant intelligence failures, which occurred prior to September 11th. At this stage of the inquiry much is already evident. First, the intelligence community said that it was at war with Osama bin Laden and had said so for three years prior to the attack of September 11th. Second, despite National Security Advisor Condaleeza Rice's assertions to the contrary, the use of a plane as a terrorist weapon, capable of causing mass casualties, was neither ingenuous nor novel but rather a method of attack that the intelligence community knew that the terrorists were considering as early as the early to mid 90s. Third, there is much troubling evidence that information crucial to preventing attacks by al-Qaeda terrorists was not shared or acted upon by intelligence officials prior to September 11th. Those intelligence failures will haunt loved ones and their families and should also haunt us and motivate us to very strong and necessary reforms. Here are just a few examples that I'm summarizing from your report: In January of 2000 the U.S. intelligence community was alerted to a meeting of al-Qaeda members in Malaysia, including two of the eventual hijackers of America Airlines Flight 77. The handoff of that information from the CIA to the FBI was bungled. The individuals were not tracked and inexplicably were not promptly placed on a watch list. Ten days later the two accomplices entered the United States on a flight to Los Angeles. The location of the individuals after they were finally placed on the watch list was also mishandled. Second, a July 10, 2001 memorandum from an FBI field agent in Phoenix to the Osama bin Laden unit and the radical fundamentalist unit at FBI headquarters, requesting that an investigation be opened into foreign terrorist training at flight schools in the U.S. was never acted upon, nor was the Phoenix field investigation shared with the CIA as specifically suggested by the FBI agent. And this is not in your memo, but this is what we learned, that nearly a year after the Phoenix memo the FBI director was unable to explain to our committee who saw that request from the Phoenix FBI agent, what was done with the request and who, if anyone, had been held accountable for letting that important information fall between some crack. Third, the August 16th, 2001 arrest of Zacarias Moussaoui and the suspicions of the FBI agents in Minneapolis that he might be planning to undertake a terrorist attack using a plane, and the urgent request that a warrant to search his computer and other belongings were not acted upon by FBI headquarters And I want to emphasize a point here. These were not some reports from unreliable sources. These were not unconfirmed statements. These were FBI agents that were asking for action. Their requests were ignored. Now, I believe it is critically important for the administration to release the Phoenix memorandum, documents relating to the Minneapolis FBI office request and other documents that will allow the American people to judge for themselves the significance of these missed signals and the failures to share information between and within the intelligence and law enforcement communities. The committee, I understand, has asked for declassification of those documents. That request is under consideration, I understand, by the administration in preparation for next week's hearings. And I -- we've had discussion about this already this morning, but I do hope that the leadership of these committees, our committees, will let the administration know that our committees will seek congressional authorization, by legislation if necessary, to declassify appropriate information if the executive branch refuses. We have chairmen and vice chairmen of our committees who have agreed on some matters. It seems to me that is enough for us as committees to automatically authorize them to seek legislation should the executive branch refuse. And that would go to future refusals, not just to previous ones. The American people understand that perfection is unattainable, but they also believe, as I do, that when errors are made, accountability -- accountability is essential if lessons are to be learned for the sake of the future security of our nation. Now, is my time up? SEN. GRAHAM: Thank you, Senator, for those very thoughtful -- (applause) -- and obviously well-received suggestions of actions by the committee. We will take those under advisement. Mr. Boswell. REP. LEONARD BOSWELL (D-IA): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think the word that's hit me hardest today has been the word ""sobering."" And as I heard the testimony of Kristen and Stephen, it caused me to have a little flashback in my earlier life when I had to spend a lonely night, as some of the rest of you have done, to write to the loved ones where their loved one was lost in the battlefield that day. I've sensed your pain. I love you, respect you, and want you to have relief. And I see the relief for you is to see that these lessons learned are learned and followed and not have to be learned again. I used to work for Admiral Flecky (sp), the -- probably the most decorated living American -- you put that in your lessons learned file and don't have to learn it again, and that's what I hope we accomplish here. I feel like that maybe my colleague from the Senate that said that maybe we don't need this extra (blue ribbon ?) panel after listening to Kristen and Stephen. I think he made a pretty good case, maybe we do need it. And I wonder about the time, and the resource, and availability to us to finish this job. Well, I trust that in the days lying ahead of you, Mr. Chairman, you're going to be dealing with this side of the operation and I know you'll give it serious consideration. A couple of questions, Ms. Hill, that I might ask, and I'll just ask them all, and then I can refresh if you need them, but I assume if -- do you intend to have further statements of fact as we go forward from here today? MS. HILL: Not today, but we do in the future hearings, right. REP. BOSWELL: I mean in the future -- all right. Would you want to elaborate a little bit on what -- or could you -- what agencies had responsibility to respond to the warnings? We've heard so much about the warnings for two, three years. Would you have any comment from your research and your study that -- who should have been responding? Military? Who? MS. HILL: Well, it would depend on what -- you mean a warning from the intelligence community or the reports? I mean -- REP. BOSWELL: Or a combination -- did we fail as part of our lesson learned, if we can, an area of -- maybe there should have been some responses going out to somebody else? MS. HILL: Well, some of the -- I mean, some of this information was disseminated further, some was not disseminated. Some, for instance, we talked about some went to the FAA in certain cases, and then they in turn would put out a warning. For instance, I talked about the one of terrorist attack to commercial, private industry. REP. BOSWELL: Okay. MS. HILL: So, it depends on the nature of what the threat was and who they would warn. But -- REP. BOSWELL: I think in your further analysis that may be what I'm asking, is that you share with us as you look at it and have more time, if there are some things that we could put in this -- MS. HILL: We are -- I can say that we are pursuing the whole issue of -- I mean, there's questions, warnings and dissemination of information, is not just sharing information, as Senator Levin was talking about, within the intelligence community, between the FBI and CIA for example, but also sharing threat information beyond the intelligence community to the agencies within government, outside the community, and also to the private sector, which gets into the warning and how far this information went. And that is an area we're looking at, and we haven't yet, you know, come back with a report on it, but we are looking at that. And -- and, you know, that's a valid point, because the intelligence -- not only is the job to get the good intelligence and to analyze it, but then to disseminate it to people who can use it in a timely manner. So -- REP. BOSWELL: Okay, thank you. And I just -- I've got a little bit of time left -- do you have any comments about the, you know, all the emphasis on bin Laden and his activities and his lack of, prior to September 11th, that is, lack of ability to -- to bring damage to us -- did that lure people into complacency, even at the senior levels? MS. HILL: I think part of it is, as I alluded to earlier, is that the community, you know, does get so much information, and as I said in this statement, there were a lot of these threats coming in, but they -- a lot of them, they couldn't really corroborate. They didn't know if some of them were true or not true. So, I think, you know, it may be human nature if you keep hearing this stuff all the time and nothing happens and you never really know if it's accurate, you tend to start disregarding. And the -- the problem is that buried in the middle of all that where some may be accurate, some may be not, there may be something that really is important that needs to be looked at. So, it may be that when the threat level was very high and all the chatter was coming through, it was hard to distinguish what was really legitimate and something they needed to be concerned about. REP. BOSWELL: Thank you very much. My time is up. I appreciate the hard work that you've presented to us, the straightforwardness, and I'm looking forward to what you further have to say as we go on from here. MS. HILL: Thank you. SEN. GRAHAM: Thank you, Mr. Boswell. Mr. Castle. REP. MICHAEL CASTLE (R-DE): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would also like to thank Ms. Breitweiser and Mr. Push for their testimony on their own behalf and on behalf of the others who have endured this. You're brave to be here, but you also had a lot to say, and from a perspective that's different than we've heard so far. And I also thank Ms. Hill for making sure that we started off with this testimony, I think it's vitally important now that we hear this. And some of my -- these are sort of statements-slash-questions, let me go through a few of them, and if we have time, perhaps you could respond to some of them, Ms. Hill, based in large part on matters that both Kristen and Stephen reference. But what has concerned me for some time, and Mr. (Boehlert ?) referenced it too, and that is the whole business of -- of public verses private, or classified information verses non-classified information. I for one have felt for some time, having served on this committee for a while now, that we over-classify terribly in the world of intelligence. You read about it the next day in the New York Times, it's about 90 percent of what you had heard about the day before. And I just have serious questions about that. But the point was made in some of their testimony about the failure to warn the public -- and I would imagine the public really didn't know much about bin Laden. Based on what you said, I'm not even sure the intelligence community knew what it should have known about bin Laden when September 11th came in 2001. We saw what the president has been able to do with Saddam Hussein, who is probably on the forefront of the minds of almost every American today. We know what can be done if there is a greater public awareness of what is going on. And a lot that's happened since September 11th of last year has caused us all to be much more aware of possible terrorist activities or whatever. I would hope as our committee looks at all this we'd look at the public aspect of it. The American public is very intelligent and very cognizant of what's going on in the world, and if they're given a chance to know what the potential problems are, my sense is that perhaps we can prevent some of the problems that we've had so far, and we shouldn't be so closed as far as intelligence is concerned. Now, I understand there are circumstances in which that cannot happen. I well understand that and I'm not trying to go too far in saying that, but I really think we need to visit that question in terms of speeches being given by people in the intelligence community perhaps could be more open in terms of information that could be released, that kind of thing. And I'm very interested in pursuing that at some point. Something that Mr. Push said I had heard earlier when I had visited the homeland security, and that is that the officials here in Washington were struck by how much the local law enforcement officers know about what's happening in their communities, about individuals in their communities, perhaps troubled individuals in their communities, various things that we probably would never know in Washington, D.C. There are a whole lot of them, you know, well over half-a-million state and local law enforcement officers who have a tremendous world of knowledge. And I think that homeland security is looking at trying to develop and to cultivate that knowledge, and to make it part of a central -- not a central bank necessarily, but the ability to have that information go up and be digested and used in dealing with terrorists and other activities in this country. I think that's vitally important. We don't hear much about that. We hear about the CIA and the FBI and NSA and various major federal agencies. When you're dealing overseas, that's probably what it's all about. But when you're dealing in America, and also even when you are dealing overseas, you are dealing with some sort of a cell or a pod or somebody who is here locally. It is very helpful to have that information. And I hope as we go about our business of this particular committee and what we are doing that we incorporate that into it as well. So that also concerns me. And there's another area that is much broader too than anything we have talked about, and that's the area of prevention overall. I am vitally concerned about the hatred that exist in the Middle East apparently, at least in certain pockets of the Middle East, for America and perhaps for Israel and other portions of the world. And I don't know how to go about this. I am not suggesting that we should be starting to formulate policy with respect to diplomacy and education, but it seems to me it is something we should be paying attention to. If we could get to the root causes of this, of why that is there, if we could start to build the relationships that might change -- this might take 10, 15 or 25 years -- but I don't think we should ignore it. And perhaps it's a little bit beyond what we are doing on this committee. But the bottom line is I think it's a very important function of what we are doing as American citizens to try to prevent terrorist activities as far as the future is concerned. And I do have a specific question -- I'd like you to comment on any of those things -- and then a specific question and I think about 10 seconds here I think -- and that is just how far along are we in terms of all of your work. Are we going to be able to get our work done by the completion of this Congress? MS. HILL: I am optimistic that we will be able to get through what we have in our minds sat down and figured would be our schedule in terms of treating various topics that we think need to be treated. Where no one can ever be sure is that things are still coming up as we investigate. You know, once you start looking at an agency, and you are going through files, what tends to happen is the more you get into it the more you start finding more things. And as we find things, we want to follow those where the facts lead and make sure we understand what did or did not happen. And that takes time. So there are some things like that that we are now working on that are going to take us more time, because we haven't planned for that. But I am cautiously optimistic we can make what I think would be a significant contribution on this whole front in terms of really understanding what did and didn't happen here before the 11th, and why we didn't know more in terms of what were the systemic problems that were preventing people from knowing more. So I can't -- I would be foolish to sit here and tell you we are going to look at every single document on terrorism that the United States government had for the last 20 years, because we haven't tried to do that. We've tried to narrow it to where we get to the relevant material that pertains to September 11th. And that I think we have a good shot at doing. REP. CASTLE: Thank you, Ms. Hill. I'll take my other statements, and perhaps we can discuss them further at some point. I yield back, Mr. Chairman. SEN. GRAHAM: Thank you, Mr. Castle. Senator Rockefeller. SEN. ROCKEFELLER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Ms. Hill, very much for your distinguished work. In the interest of time, Mr. Chairman, I would like to make just three points. First, the fundamental question is what did the intelligence community know and then what did they do with what they knew? The work of the committee has not to this point unearthed any single piece of information, or smoking gun, if you will, that would have in and of itself prevented the attack. But we have found far too many breakdowns in the intelligence gathering and processing method. My own conclusion is that given the events and signals of the preceding decade, the intelligence community could have, and in my judgment should have, anticipated an attack on U.S. soil on the scale of 9/11. We had witnessed attacks on Americans overseas, as you laid out -- U.S.S. Cole, Kenya, Tanzania, Khobar, 1993 attack on the World Trade Center. We knew beyond any doubt that al Qaeda wanted to strike the United States. We were just sort of struck in our classic American innocence that anything that is going to happen is going to happen overseas. But there was information, and plenty of it, disseminated or not disseminated, that something was going to happen here. Yet the intelligence community for a whole host of reasons did not launch the all-out effort that is its responsibility, that might have detected and potentially prevented 9/11. Second, the FBI is an outstanding law enforcement agency, but I have serious questions about whether it is the right place to do intelligence work necessary in our country. Law enforcement is not necessarily compatible with intelligence gathering; in fact, it is not. It is not the same skills, not the same mission. Going forward we must not undermine the FBI's ability to carry out its fundamental responsibilities, because they are very important, and they do it very well. And we must not give short shrift to new intelligence demands. So we have to ask ourselves, Can the problem be addressed by reforming the FBI? I don't think so. Or is this a case where we need to find a wholly different solution? This is a tough question, obviously, which I hope this committee will be tackling in the coming months, and it leads me to my final point. Are we ready -- as a committee, as a Congress, as a government, as a people -- not only to pose the tough questions -- it's easy to do -- but also to find and to implement the tough solutions? It is clear to all of us that we must make serious changes in how we gather, process and react to intelligence in this country. Our existing agencies came into being in the Cold War -- that's fine. That structure no longer matches the threat that we face. Lines of authority are, in my judgment, blurred intentionally for the sake of turf, for the sake of all kinds of things which in some cases have justification and in many cases do not. The whole process leading up to today has been an interesting example of how difficult it is to get, you know at a very common purpose, to get people to agree on some relatively simple things. So lines of authority are blurred, information gets lost, and the mission is unfocused. The intelligence mission is unfocused. It might best be described as trying to do everything, and in the process doing little well. Far-reaching change isn't just a goal, it's a necessity. Unfortunately, it's a very controversial and very uncomfortable necessity. It's something they don't want to do here in Congress, they don't want to do at the White House, they don't want to do at the Defense Department, they don't want to do in the non-defense intelligence aspect of what we carry on in this country. But are we going to find the political will to create an intelligence system that works? Or are we going to say that this is going to be politically impractical or probably not doable, and therefore cut our goal by 50 percent, and then get leveraged down from there? So are we as a committee in which we have our own differences and our own conflicts -- as a Congress, where the same exists, and as a government where the same exists, and in the intelligence community where the same exists -- do we have the political will and the strength and the determination to do the job right? Nothing else counts. Thank you. SEN. GRAHAM: Thank you, senator. Mr. Roemer. REP. ROEMER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank Ms. Hill for an excellent presentation and outline this afternoon to help us understand this issue a bit more after several months of this investigation. I want to compliment your top-notch staff for their sacrifices and their hours of service to the country. And, Mr. Chairman, you and Mr. Goss on my side -- I want to compliment both of you for bringing together in a bipartisan way this committee to launch an unprecedented bicameral investigation into the worst terrorist attack in our nation's history. And it is with pride and confidence that I know we will produce a good product on this committee. In listening to the very moving testimony from Kristen and Steve this morning, I am even more convinced, I am even more compelled to work hard. I am even more persuaded that an independent blue-ribbon commission is the right way to go. It's the right way to go, because if this committee with its jurisdiction and its might and insight, and experience and dedication to intelligence, does its job, and by the very nature of an investigative inquiry staff doing their job over an eight-month period, unearthing facts, uncovering data, asking tough questions, they will produce even more questions for us to try to answer over the next year. So I think there is a compelling case by the very effectiveness of this committee to do its job near perfectly, and assume its jurisdiction as a body of Congress to take on this tough task, we make the case in a very convincing way for follow-up, and a thread attached to this for an independent blue ribbon commission to continue to look at these very, very tough questions, as to how to reorganize an intelligence community that made mistakes, that committed failures, that saw warnings, and reorganize it in a time when we are threatened by a brand-new source that wants to kill Americans in massive numbers very quickly. And they can do it in this kind of world environment. I think the case is made compellingly for an independent blue ribbon commission. And I think that complements us. And I think it adds into the history of this committee, the Intelligence Committee, which has had independent commission, as Aspin-Brown, Hart-Rudman, the NRO, Rumsfeld on ICBMs, and even in the Senate bill a brand-new commission to study something else. Ms. Hill, I do have a question or two that I wanted to ask about the classification of data. On page 16 there is a reference to information provided to senior U.S. government officials in September of 1998, and on page 28 mentioning senior government officials in July of 2001. Now, without getting into breaking our classification -- and we don't want to do that -- one would be a Democratic administration, one would be a Republican administration. Is there the possibility that those references might be, could be, to a White House? MS. HILL: Well, you know, obviously given the classification -- REP. ROEMER: I'm just asking in the realm of possibilities. MS. HILL: Well, I guess are you asking the term ""senior government officials"" couldn't -- I mean, I guess the term ""senior government officials"" would be anyone at a senior level in the entire U.S. government. So -- but I cannot -- as I understand the rules on this, we are not allowed -- REP. ROEMER: But your case, Ms. Hill, is that it is important for the American people to know when we get intelligence that it is not only intelligence agencies that act upon it, it's the administration, as to what they do with it, with the military, with other branches of government, the FAA -- MS. HILL: Right. REP. ROEMER: The Border Patrol and so forth and so on. MS. HILL: That's absolutely right, because to make intelligence really the way it should be, important and valuable, it has to be not only collected, analyzed, but it has to be disseminated to the people who can use it in a timely manner. That's the whole point of having intelligence. So -- REP. ROEMER: Part of our bipartisan efforts would be to get in a bipartisan way this access to declassifying that kind of reference. Is that your argument? MS. HILL: Well, I mean, our argument on this issue about the White House is that if you have declassified the information itself, it seems to us we don't see the national security interests in declassifying where it goes from there. If you declassify it it goes to some people, and you should be able to declassify, it goes to everybody, or whoever it went to to explain the -- REP. ROEMER: I would hope our committee would have a long, very serious discussion about what to do on the classification issue. Finally, Ms. Hill, if I could ask one final question, you mentioned the CTC and the number of analysts that they had, and I think mentioned a number of three to five. MS. HILL: Right. REP. ROEMER: Yet as we've looked at the CTC budget over the 1990s and a question of resources, without mentioning a specific number, which is classified, the trend which we can talk about -- right? MS. HILL: Right. REP. ROEMER: -- is quadrupling in the CTC budget. So why isn't more money put into analysts in that budget which is quadrupling? MS. HILL: I think it's a priority question. I mean, it's -- you know, as the -- and what we found and what we are saying is that the resources -- that we are getting more resources for counterterrorism prior to September 11th and after the DCI declared war on bin Laden it was going up. But there was no massive shift. It was a gradual thing. And in terms of the analysis, there was not a significant amount of resources dedicated to it. So I assume it is like every other resource allocation: it is depending on where your priorities are. And obviously there was not a big priority on the analysis. REP. ROEMER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. SEN. GRAHAM: Thank you, Mr. Roemer. Mr. LaHood. REP. LAHOOD: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ms. Hill, thank you for your service to our committee -- and to your staff too -- I know they've worked long hours. MS. HILL: That's very true, and they've done an excellent job. They really have. I agree with that. And to Kristen and Steve, thank you for -- if you are still here -- for being here -- and your testimony and the people that you represent. Obviously our hearts go out to all of you. Ms. Hill, if you take all the information that's in your report today and you analyze all that information, and then you look at the notion that there was a lot of information prior to 9/11, there were a lot of people in separate ways who saw it, and if you took that information and it was analyzed correctly, and the people responsible, whether it would be the president, the vice president, the national security advisor, the CIA director or FBI director -- if they had had all the information that you collected and documented in your report, could 9/11 have been prevented? If they had seen the Phoenix memo, if they had seen the memo from Minnesota. If they had seen -- really had all of these transits, these documents that had come over the transit for any number of days? I mean, there has to be some idea about -- because the criticism is that a lot of information came, but it wasn't shared; a lot of information was available, but wasn't shared, and the right people didn't know it. Well, if you take all that information, and if it had been shared with the highest elected people in our government and the highest appointed people in our government who have responsibility for counteracting these activities, could 9/11 have been prevented? MS. HILL: My own view is that I don't think anyone will ever be able to say -- no one will ever really know whether 9/11 could have been prevented, because what we are talking about here is we not only would have to know what everyone would have done with the information they had in the intelligence community in terms of law enforcement and intelligence, you would also have to know how bin Laden and the hijackers would have reacted. We don't know that. I mean, it's all -- we are hypothesizing. And there has been so much emphasis on was there a smoking gun, was there a -- when, where, how -- that sort of thing. We didn't find -- we haven't found that. What we have found is a lot of information, a lot of things that weren't put together. And to me maybe the biggest issue is, and we say it somewhat in the statement -- not only that they weren't put together, but they weren't recognizing the importance, given everything else they should have known for instance in the summer of 2001 -- that's the summer that you had Midhar, Alhazmi, you had Phoenix, you had Moussaoui, you had a high threat level. Well, you would think with all of that, when you got Phoenix or you got Moussaoui, it would have been even more -- you would have been more aggressive with it, and that didn't happen. So there's a lot of unknowns. There's questions whether people would have -- if you had caught hijacker would they have replaced him with someone else? There's questions about could you, if you had gotten onto one of these cases, could you have surveiled and perhaps found what was going on? All of those are hypotheticals, and we are never going to know. But I think what we do clearly know is that the community could have done a lot better on the intelligence side and the law enforcement side. REP. LAHOOD: But your answer is that the community could have done a lot better. But knowing what we know about information that was there -- and the dots were never connected in a lot of these different areas -- you are not saying though that the community could have prevented this. They could have done a lot better, but they couldn't have prevented -- MS. HILL: I'm saying they could have -- REP. LAHOOD: But they couldn't have prevented it? MS. HILL: No, I didn't say that. I never said they couldn't have. REP. LAHOOD: What I want to know -- I want you to be able to tell us pretty definitively here for these people that are here, that if all the dots were connected, and all the information was shared, and all the right people would have known it, could we have prevented 9/11? MS. HILL: I would say -- REP. LAHOOD: That's the criticism all over this town and all over the country and all over the world -- that we, you know, we collected a lot of information but it wasn't connected, that people didn't connect the dots, they didn't share the information. And my question is, and I think it's a question on the minds of the American people, if it had been done correctly, could it have been prevented. And people that are promoting a blue ribbon committee, which I am not, are saying that that's the way we get to the bottom line. But I want to know from you, who have been working at this now for several month, could it have been prevented? MS. HILL: I, I can't say guaranteed that it could have been prevented. There could have been some things done that there's possible that they might have been able to uncover some of this plot if they had had the information on individuals, and they had followed them and they had surveiled them. And the individuals had talked about something and they might have picked it up. I mean, all of those are ifs. It's one if after another. You're never going to know that, but if you don't get beyond the point that they could have done better, you know, that is what they have to do the next time. Because if they don't, you're not going to have a shot at preventing this the next time. That's where the issue is. Not so much preventing what's already happened. It's preventing what may happen in the future that we have to focus on. That's my own view. And I think to prevent what may happen in the future, there's a lot of things that have to be done to get us there. SEN. GRAHAM: Thank you, Mr. LaHood. Let me say, tomorrow we're going to have two panels with five persons in total, all of whom have had extensive experience at the highest level of actually making decisions based on intelligence. And I would suggest the question you just asked of Ms. Hill would be a very appropriate question to ask of those panelists to get their assessment of whether there was enough information from the experience and perspective that they had and can provide as to whether there was enough to have avoided September the 11th. Mr. Hoekstra. REP. PETER HOEKSTRA (R-MI): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I'd like to thank the chairmen for how they started off these public hearings, I believe, with Steve and Kristen today. It's a very appropriate way to begin the process by remembering those whose families paid the ultimate sacrifice on September 11 and recognizing the sense of urgency and the importance with which this committee has to go through and conduct its work. And, Ms. Hill, thank you for your work -- MS. HILL: Thank you. REP. HOEKSTRA: -- having gone through some other investigations on other committees, recognizing the importance of how you approach this work and the intensity and the professionalism and having to put up with members of Congress. So thank you for being willing to go through that process. As you've gone through and done the analysis, have you also taken a look at other attempted terrorist activities during this time frame which may have been prevented because of knowledge that we had beforehand and things that might not be part of the public record? Have you uncovered anything like that? MS. HILL: You mean other actions by other groups or other -- REP. HOEKSTRA: By al Qaeda or other groups that -- where they had been planning on attacking the United States and, for one reason or another, those attacks were thwarted? MS. HILL: We have heard some of that. I mean, we have not focused on that because we were focusing on the information on aircrafts as weapons and September 11th. But certainly, in talking to people, there were successes by the intelligence community against al Qaeda and other terrorist groups. There were also, you know, failures. REP. HOEKSTRA: Other failures. MS. HILL: So, I mean, it was -- and I think -- I didn't read that part, but in our statement we talk about the fact that they did -- that it was a very difficult target for the intelligence community. Al Qaeda had a lot of operational security. They were hard to penetrate. They were hard to get them to talk about things that would help you. It was difficult. There were resource problems. But despite all that, the community did amass a lot of information on them and they were engaged in operations against al Qaeda and there were some successes, but there were also some failures. REP. HOEKSTRA: As you go through this process, will you also overlay policy decisions that were made, either in Congress or at the executive level? Specifically, I think, this morning Steve talked about -- and I'm not sure exactly what the words were -- but the inability to penetrate organizations like al Qaeda with human intelligence and recognizing that during parts of the '90s, you know, there were decisions that were made that changed the way that the CIA and other organizations could actually recruit human intelligence. MS. HILL: I think that area -- I mean, those are all valid policy questions, and it's relevant to how you, you know, how you combat terrorism in groups like this, obviously, because penetrating a group like this is tremendously important. It's a valuable source of intelligence. But I think those are issues that we will probably address. As I understand the chairman, one of the things we want to do as we get further away from the facts -- we're trying to get the factual review out first. That is a systemic problem -- and then look at possible ways to reform the community and changes and policy issues and those sorts of things. So I would guess that those issues would be addressed once we get into where do we go from here in terms of reform. REP. HOEKSTRA: Because it's very, very clear that the intelligence community and the various agencies don't operate in a vacuum. There are policies and decisions that are made over a period of time that will have an impact on the culture within the various agencies as to their ability to recruit or how they will use or who they will access for human intelligence. There's also decisions that are made by Congress in terms of the funding levels and direction and those types of things. And, you know, as the report moves forward, we will get a fuller context of where the breakdowns will be, some of which may have occurred within the intelligence agencies, some of which may have occurred in other parts of the executive branch, or some of which may have occurred in Congress because of decisions that have been made over here, so that we get that full picture of what went on. MS. HILL: Right. REP. HOEKSTRA: That will all be -- those are all areas that you plan on looking at? MS. HILL: I mean, the game plan, so to speak, is to look at the factual review, get through that, then look at the systemic issues and then decide how those systemic issues can be addressed through reform. And what you're talking about, I think, would be in the systemic-issue problems, restrictions on our ability to penetrate human sources, hum- int, and then where we go from here in terms of reform. REP. HOEKSTRA: Good. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, I yield back my time. SEN. GRAHAM: Thank you very much. Senator Shelby. SEN. SHELBY: Thank you. Ms. Hill, I've missed some of this because, like everybody, we have to do other things during the meeting. Would it be fair to say at this point in the inquiry, the investigation, that we're a long way from finishing our inquiry, are we not? MS. HILL: I like to look at it -- I like to be optimistic rather than pessimistic. And I would say I think we've made a significant good start down the road. SEN. SHELBY: Well, I think we've -- MS. HILL: We're not finished but, you know, I think we've done a fair amount of work here and we're getting -- we have a good record on the facts so far. SEN. SHELBY: But you're a veteran investigator, a veteran prosecutor, inspector general at DOD. We all know this and we have a lot of respect for you. But in any investigation, you don't know what's going to turn up next, do you? MS. HILL: Right. SEN. SHELBY: And you're not telling us here today and the American people that you see the end of this investigation. MS. HILL: No, I think I said previously, in response to another question, that in any investigation, the more you dig, you find things, and then you have to have time to go through those things. SEN. SHELBY: Analyze it. MS. HILL: And we are -- that has happened. It's happening, just like it happens in any investigation. And we're trying to follow those facts where they lead. Now, whether all of that will be finished by whenever this is determined to end, I don't know. But I think we'll make a significant contribution and will have made a good -- SEN. SHELBY: I think you're already making a significant contribution, and I think the staff is. My concern is that we don't know what we don't know. MS. HILL: Correct. SEN. SHELBY: And I have the feeling that there's more out there, because I raised this morning -- I raised the issue in opening statements that I don't believe, as a member of the committee, that we've had the utmost support by the agencies that we're investigating. And I don't believe that we've had the support that was promised at the outset, you know, by the administration. Having said that, I want to focus just what little time I have on the FBI. You may have talked about this earlier -- I know you addressed it -- and that is the analytical component of the FBI. MS. HILL: Right. SEN. SHELBY: We know that the FBI has got good people. We know that they're great on investigations. They have no peer, I believe. MS. HILL: Right. SEN. SHELBY: But on analysis of intelligence information, some of us have been on the committee -- and this is my eighth year here -- that we've been concerned with that for a long time. It's hard to put an intelligence division or component together and make it work. Tell us, in your judgment, what was the state of the analytical component of the FBI before September the 11th, from what you know? MS. HILL: Well, on terrorism, basically, yeah. SEN. SHELBY: As far as terrorism is concerned. MS. HILL: The FBI -- I mean, our figures -- we have the figures in the statement -- they, I think, had one individual working on al Qaeda -- SEN. SHELBY: One individual working al Qaeda before September the 11th in the analysis. MS. HILL: Analysis, right. And, you know, my own personal view -- and you alluded to it -- and I have worked with the FBI for many, many years -- SEN. SHELBY: I know you have. MS. HILL: -- starting when I was a prosecutor, and I agree with you. I think they are tremendous investigators. And in terms of law enforcement, they can be the best on some cases in prosecutions. But that's their mission. Their mission is to do an investigation, to do a prosecution, to do a case. If it's their case and their mission, their prosecution, they will go to the nth degree. And they're very aggressive, and we need that. But they are not -- at least in my experience, their training and their mission does not focus on going beyond that into the broader analytical world and looking at the big picture. They are focused on their case. And it's too bad, because their aggressiveness would be very good if they could also channel it, at least on issues like terrorism, a little broader onto the analytical. SEN. SHELBY: Well, before September 11th, they only had one person in the whole bureau working on that, you just testified to. Is that correct? On al Qaeda. MS. HILL: Yeah. And I just have a note from our staff, who has done a lot of these interviews, that it was at the FBI they had one individual doing strategic analysis is what we're talking about. SEN. SHELBY: That's right. MS. HILL: They did have some others that were doing, as she calls, operational analysis, which I interpret that to mean that was connected with prosecutions and cases. So there were individuals doing that. SEN. SHELBY: Do we think that there is a way to get the FBI changed, or at least part of it, toward strategic analysis of information dealing with terrorism in the future? I know we talked to the director about this. But that's harder to do than it is to say, isn't it? MS. HILL: Well, I think it's not only getting them to expand their focus. I mean, it's like any job or profession in an agency. They have to be able to give people incentives in terms of career and profession and those sorts of things to make the analysis positions in the FBI important positions, that people want to do. SEN. SHELBY: One of my lights is on. I guess I'll -- I'll wait another round, Mr. Chairman. REP. GOSS: Ms. Pelosi. REP. PELOSI: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I want to join others in commending Ms. Hill on the excellent work that she and the members of her very able staff have performed. I hope, I hope that it is a comfort to the families to know how persistent and thorough this staff is in this investigation, in this inquiry, however limited it is strictly to intelligence. And as was mentioned earlier, there are other agencies of government beyond the intelligence community that need some review as well. The question of could it have been prevented, of course, is one that will haunt us as long as we exist as a country. And there's no good answer. The good news is the bad news. If the answer is no, it could not have been prevented, that means we're very exposed in the future. If it means yes, it could have been prevented, that's good news because that bodes well for the future, but it's a tragedy, obviously, for the families. It's a tragedy in any event, but if it could have been prevented, we'll all be haunted by the guilt associated with that. And that's not even good enough punishment for us. There will be hell to -- that's going up to September 11th. Post-September 11th, if any of these agencies of government in the intelligence community are not dealing honestly with us -- and by that I mean being forthcoming with information -- if, as Mr. Shelby says, there's other information to come that we don't know about now, I believe there will be hell to pay for them, because we all assume that everyone is doing their best to protect our country, and they must help us get to the bottom of this. I trust that they are helping us all they can, but we must continue the inquiry. I think, as one who originally supported an independent commission -- I was original author of it, and we passed in committee; we failed on the floor -- the idea, I think, is an important one. However, it does not in any way undermine the important work of this inquiry. As Mr. Roemer has said and others have said, this piece of it that goes into the intelligence committee is very important. We could have had the best intelligence in the world, though, and what we found out was that, since September 11th, is that the hijackers and the al Qaeda knew something about us that we did not know about ourselves, and that is that we had tremendous exposure at the airports. That all four of these hijackings could have been successful is remarkable. I find it remarkable that maybe one would get by, but four of them to succeed -- in their words succeed -- is remarkable to me. So my question to you, Ms. Hill, is, on this subject your report is clear, but I would just like to see if you could shed some further light. As you were looking into this issue of the hijackers -- and we'll go more into it in a couple of days -- but did you see a distinction made between hijacking -- of course, tat's a predictable threat to us -- and using airplanes as weapons as two distinct threats? Because from our perspective, many of us, a hijacking is still the loss of many, many lives and should have been taken as seriously as hijacking with intent to do further damage. MS. HILL: Well, we certainly, when we went out looking for information and requesting information from the agencies, distinguished it, because we were asking for information on the use of aircraft as weapons. So that would imply more than the usual just hijack a plane to get somewhere or take hostages or whatever. But in terms of, you know, being prepared to address it and your comments about why, you know, why they were able to hijack all four of these plans and our defenses were down, there's probably less of a distinction. And I point to the FAA-FBI assessment that we quote in this staff statement. I think that year, which was, I believe, 2000, they were looking at the whole threat, terrorist threat, to civil aviation. So they were not distinguishing between aircrafts as weapons or hijacking. And what was interesting about it is that they were concluding that there was a small domestic threat, so they were not too concerned about any sort of terrorist threat to domestic U.S. aviation here in the United States as late as 2000. REP. PELOSI: Well, I find that to be a serious shortcoming -- MS. HILL: Right. REP. PELOSI: -- separate and apart from not knowing the time and place and date -- MS. HILL: Right. REP. PELOSI: -- the fact that the entire threat was minimized to that extent. So I do see the need, as I had said before, to assess the performance of any agency beyond the intelligence agencies, which have a responsibility to (protect?) acts of terrorism and to look with fresh eyes and some innovative thinking on our intelligence and all other aspects of protecting the American people in this regard. And, of course, as Senator Rockefeller said, we must do it right. But I think doing it right also means protecting our civil liberties. So we have quite a challenge. And your presentation this morning and the work of your staff has been a valuable contribution. Thank you. MS. HILL: Thank you. REP. PELOSI: I look forward to following hearings. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. SEN. GRAHAM: Thank you, Ms. Pelosi. Mr. Goss. REP. GOSS: Thank you. Let me advise members of the House that there's 10 minutes left on a vote in the House, so my wrap-up will be very quick. First of all, I want to thank Ms. Hill for a very excellent presentation. MS. HILL: Thank you. REP. GOSS: I liked the version that we had before it had been redacted better, and I expect that we are going to continue to press on, because I do believe that there is more that can be revealed. And along that area, is it fair for me to make a statement that because of the joint staff, we now know some things that we otherwise certainly would not have known? Is that a fair statement? MS. HILL: I would hope so, yes. I would say so. REP. GOSS: That is certainly my feeling as well. And I hope that much of that can be shared with the American people. The second question I wanted to ask or provide some guidance on, from my perspective, is in your excellent report this morning on intelligence reporting on bin Laden's intentions to strike inside the United States, on pages 14 and 15 of your report -- 15 and 16 -- were a series of specifics that cries out to say, ""Why was all this ignored? Where was the audience? Why was nobody listening?"" And one of the issues that I would like to have further amplification on this is if this was 2 percent of the reporting, what was the other 98 percent of the reporting that was consuming the analysts' time in the intelligence community? I'm not asking for an answer now. MS. HILL: Right. REP. GOSS: I think that is going to be helpful for our report. The next question, I think, is self-evident, and others have said it. There's no doubt that some of the questions members here have addressed today to you are more appropriate for witnesses that will be forthcoming, and I want to make sure that we understand that there will be other witnesses forthcoming and we will try and have as much of that as public as we can, as it should be. But the very penetrating questions that were asked by Ms. Breitweiser and Mr. Push and the recommendations, I think, are an excellent point, and each one of them deserves consideration, and we'll get them at some point. In fact, some of them have already been given consideration, as I'm sure you know. And finally, with regard to the remarks about Senator Levin and Senator Rockefeller on declassification, my view is that the burden is on the administration to tell us why we must preserve classification unless it's in those areas, those exempt areas that I spoke to -- sources, methods, plans and intentions, and ongoing prosecutions by the Justice Department. The final point I would make is that the work of this committee will be done. There is no question about that. And there will continue to be oversight by the United States Congress in a number of areas, including in the intelligence committees, no matter who the members are of that committee. So this is an issue that is not going to be dropped merely because another date flips up on a calendar or there is a change of personnel somewhere in the establishment. This will go forward because the American people deserve the answer and they will get the answer. And I thank you very much for your participation today, and an excellent job, Ms. Hill. MS. HILL: Thank you. REP. GOSS: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. SEN. GRAHAM: Thank you, Mr. Goss. Senator Feinstein. SEN. FEINSTEIN: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I certainly concur with the remarks that have been made about the excellence of the report. MS. HILL: Thank you. SEN. FEINSTEIN: I'm just sorry I couldn't get it until the meeting, so I had to spend my time reading it during the meeting, which, Mr. Chairman, I would suggest is not the best way of enabling us to carry out our duties. SEN. GRAHAM: Senator, as you know, we made the original non- redacted version available in both the House and the Senate Intelligence Committee rooms, and I understand that you took advantage of that. Unfortunately, it was only within the last less than 36 hours that we got back from the declassification agencies the version that we could make public. I hope that in the future we and they will do a better job and a more expeditious job so that will give us an opportunity to know what's going to be public with more lead time. SEN. FEINSTEIN: I thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ms. Hill, on December the 4th, 1998, the DCI told his deputies, in a memo about bin Laden and al Qaeda, that ""We are at war. I want no resources or people spared in this effort, either inside CIA or the community."" Yet in your testimony, you indicate that when it came time to translate that declaration of war into real resources, the government's efforts fell woefully short. Specifically you concluded that the allocation of intelligence community resources did not adequately reflect the true war against bin Laden. For example, you point out in 1999 the CTC at CIA had only three analysts assigned to the bin Laden network worldwide. And after 2000, that number had risen to just five and that things were even worse outside the CIA. The international terrorism analytic unit at the FBI had in place only one analyst to address al Qaeda -- this out of an intelligent budget of literally billions of dollars every year. Now, it really concerns me, because I was one that felt very strongly that the warnings that something was going to happen were there, and certainly by July I was -- just based on what I heard in this committee -- 100 percent certain that something was going to happen. I even said that on national television, that I thought it was going to happen within the next three months. And my question really goes to the fact that whether today even we have enough to do what we need to do -- why do you think so little attention, even after these declarations of war, were really paid when it came to devoting real resources, and what was taking a higher priority? MS. HILL: I -- I think -- we have asked that to many people in the community, and I will give you -- again, I have to be careful the details of it, because we are in a public session. But I think what we are hearing is that there were other priorities that the intelligence -- one reaction would be that people would tell you that the intelligence community responds to its customers -- customers being other parts of government that are tasking them to come up with intelligence on certain items, and that in some respects there were customers that they had to satisfy, they felt they had to satisfy and were told to satisfy on other topics other than al Qaeda. So that was one issue that we've heard. We have heard in the FBI on this -- the resources. There was -- as we just discussed with Senator Shelby, there was not many -- there was like one strategic analyst for al Qaeda in the FBI. There were some more analysts on operations, and there was a much bigger emphasis in the FBI on operations, on cases, investigations, as opposed to strategic analysis, even though it was on al Qaeda, which was a high threat. But their mission was more focused on actual prosecutions and cases. So I think as with any resource issue it was a question of other priorities, customers demanding other things, and the agencies responding to them. SEN. FEINSTEIN: Do you believe that today there are sufficient resources? MS. HILL: We have not, senator -- you know, we know some of the details as to how things have jumped since September 11th in terms of resources, but we have not focused intently on what is going on post- September 11th, because our job has been to try and find out what was happening before September 11th. So I wouldn't -- I really would not feel probably qualified to start guessing as to whether it's adequate now. SEN. FEINSTEIN: On page 15 -- SEN. GRAHAM: Senator, we will have another round after this round. SEN. FEINSTEIN: I don't even get the time our question took up. Never mind. Thank you. SEN. GRAHAM: Senator Mikulski. SEN. MIKULSKI: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, a few words to the families and then a question for Ms. Hill. To the families, first of all, my name is Barbara Mikulski. I am a United States senator, and I am from the state of Maryland. I had people die at the World Trade Center, and I also had 60 Marylanders die at the Pentagon in the plane and in the inferno there. I also believe I owe my life to the gallantry of the men and women who fought on 93, because I do believe the plane was heading towards us. And I have two constituents who died in the anthrax attack on us. So know that I am absolutely on your side. And I want you to know that I thank you today for coming, because you show such inspirational strength and courage, and I believe you have a right to know about what happened, you have a right to be heard in any public forum, and I believe Americans have a right to be protected. I know that you are still looking for answers on why this happened, how it happened, and how it doesn't happen again. Know I would support a vote to establish an independent commission. I believe my committee has done an outstanding job. But I believe when such an impact happens to America and its families, we need more than one opinion on how to make sure it never happens again. What I find -- I find many things about what happened troubling. But what I find most troubling is that four of the terrorists were stopped by local law enforcement -- four for speeding, and one for not having a driver's license. They were actually in the hands of law enforcement. But when they were stopped, and the police went to check the databases, nothing alerted them to detain these men. Something is wrong here. State troopers, like the one in my own state that stopped one of these thugs, and other police officers know more when they check their database, know more about men being behind in their child support -- the database will tell them -- than they do about men who are possibly around a terrorist attack. There are more than 50 different watch lists to keep track of people dangerous to the United States. But, guess what, if you are a watch list, you don't talk to other watch lists. If you are a watch list, you like live in one of those caves. You might not know if there are other watch lists out there. You don't tell anyone that you are a watch list, and you certainly don't talk to each other, make friends with the other watch list, or make friends with law enforcement. That's really I think unacceptable. And these will be the questions I am going to direct to Ms. Hill, because like you I want to be sure that this committee gets answers for you and the rest of America on how we can detect, deter, disrupt and defeat any attack on the United States of America. And, having said that, Ms. Hill, you know about these watch lists -- you know that they are all over the place and they are nowhere. In our work with you and my colleagues, I wanted to see if there was a smoking gun. I wanted to know what were the systemic problems and what were the solutions. I am not sure there is a smoking gun, but these watch lists are definitely a systemic problem. Could you elaborate them, the ones you can, or where you would see solutions are going on the watch lists? MS. HILL: The watch list issue, senator, we are -- I am aware of it. We are going to go into that in more detail when we get to the hearing on the hijackers, because as you alluded to that is an issue regarding Midhar and Alhamzi. I mean, that's a very big issue. It's an issue of getting it on the right watch list, getting it to the right people. But, even before that, it's also an issue of getting it between the intelligence community and the law enforcement community, and breaking down the reluctance sometimes to share information across the -- from the intelligence community to the criminal investigators and law enforcement on the other side. And that I think may also play on some of this. So, but those are issues that we will talk about when we look at the hijacker case. And, you are right, they are a problem. SEN. MIKULSKI: Well, let me just say this before the yellow goes to red: I raised the issue of a smoking gun. I have been in many hearings. Do you believe that there is a smoking gun on what went wrong, or was it just a series of total disconnects? MS. HILL: Well, we -- of course I am handicapped in answering that, because we are in a public session and we are still looking at a number of other issues that have come up. But I don't think in any of what we have seen here, smoking gun -- if you mean by smoking gun that somebody had information of when, where, how this was going to happen in the United States government -- we have not found that. But, you know, I had a discussion -- actually with one of our staff -- on this the other day, and he pointed out wisely that there has been so much discussion about looking for a smoking gun. The truth is you hardly ever get a, quote, ""smoking gun"" in not just terrorism, but in a criminal case, et cetera, et cetera. And if by focusing all the time on we have the smoking gun, you know, we have to be ready to go if we have a smoking gun, the truth is most of the time you will never have a smoking gun, and it is a lot harder to find it when you don't have one. So what we ought to be focusing on is how to get our system ready to find these guys when you don't have a smoking gun, which is what you are going to be faced with most of the time, just -- you know, the odds are you are not going to have that. And we need to have our intelligence and law enforcement people good enough and bright enough and aggressive enough that they can track these guys down and find this, even when there is no smoking gun, because my own experience at least in law enforcement is that's what you have most of the time. SEN. MIKULSKI: Thank you. SEN. GRAHAM: Thank you, senator. Senator Kyl. And Senator Kyl has submitted an opening statement which will be placed in the record. SEN. KYL: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. By the way, I think that last point is a very important point that needs to be underscored, and it's one of the most important things that comes from this -- from your statement today, Ms. Hill. MS. HILL: Thank you, senator. SEN. KYL: I was this morning detained in my office waiting for a couple of phone calls, but I had my television on the entire time, and was privileged to hear not only the statements of the chairman of our committee, but also the statements made by Ms. Breitweiser and Mr. Push. And as has been expressed by others here, my heart goes out to them and the families and families that they represent. And I think that I should state that I am certain that every American shares their grief and their anger, and even their frustration. And I also share their view that there's more we could have done to try to prevent the terrorism we experienced on September 11th. I also agree with Eleanor Hill that at the end of the day it is doubtful we will ever find a smoking gun. But, as she said, the important point is to be in a better position to deal with the other pieces of information in order to try to prevent this in the future. I do think, Mr. Chairman, that it is very unclear whether the joint investigation -- the joint committee investigation that we are engaged in here, and whatever report we eventually submit will satisfy these witnesses and those that they represent, or whether they will satisfy members of this committee, let alone the other members of the House and the Senate. As you know, Mr. Chairman, I have expressed serious reservations about the direction of our investigation, including the allocation of time and resources to holding open hearings at this time before we have finished our work. Ours is a large undertaking, and we have got a lot more work to do before our fast-approaching deadline. And yet we are proceeding with public hearings, in spite of not having completed that investigation. What was presented today was only a staff document -- I am talking now about the testimony of Ms. Hill. It was not a consensus product. The committee members had no practical input into this interim report -- I think the public should know. Ordinarily we investigate, we write our report, and then we present our recommendations. The staff's presentation of its interim report before member vetting is therefore in my view premature as well as a diversion of the joint staff from the investigation that we have given them the job to do. The interim statement from our joint inquiry staff provides some very valuable information about what has been done to date -- a chronology of events leading to the September 11th attacks and some background information about the growing threat of al Qaeda over the last decade. It is very useful to have this history, and it's important to make it public. But the committee should have approved it first. And in any event, the release of the report could have been done without taking the time to have it read by the staff director. But, more importantly, I believe that questions fundamental to our investigation have yet to be pursued adequately. These include -- include, but are not limited to -- whether part of the pre-September 11th problem was a result of a culture of risk aversion in the intelligence community, and/or an inadequate allocation and improper prioritization of resources to those on the front lines of our counterterror efforts. Mr. Chairman, you know I have expressed before my concern that committee members have been able to play only a limited role in this inquiry. It's largely being conducted by the joint committee staff with little input by or to our own committee staffs, let alone the members themselves. And that will make it difficult to concur in the final product without reservations. We will not know what we haven't been told; and therefore we will not be able to vouch unequivocally for the final product. Questions about this investigative process have led to calls for the creation of a national commission to investigate all of these matters. This would further stress the intelligence community at the very time we are trying to fight the war on terrorism. While it may be deemed necessary, it can hardly be deemed desirable. So I hope, Mr. Chairman, that we can continue to work to resolve these issues. Only by doing our very best will we have done our duty to the victims who are represented here today, and to the American people. SEN. GRAHAM: Senator, thank you. Senator Bayh is supposed to be en route. If Senator Shelby has -- SEN. SHELBY: If you will let me ask until he comes. SEN. GRAHAM: And then I have a couple of questions I am going to ask at the conclusion of Senator Bayh's questions. Senator Shelby. SEN. SHELBY: Mrs. Hill, I would like to go back to the FBI and the analytical component we were talking about earlier -- MS. HILL: Right, right. SEN. SHELBY: -- or lack thereof. In your investigation regarding the analytical ability of the FBI, do you know if the FBI prior to September the 11th ever did an analysis of terrorist tactics? That is, terrorist tactics with the possible use of airplanes as weapons? MS. HILL: I don't believe so. We -- as I think -- SEN. SHELBY: You're saying no -- MS. HILL: As the statement says, we haven't found any analysis of the use of aircraft as weapons in the community, as far as I know, including the FBI. SEN. SHELBY: In the community -- you are talking about the intelligence community -- MS. HILL: Yeah, but we would include -- SEN. SHELBY: Not just the FBI? MS. HILL: Right. I think it's safe to say the FBI also. SEN. SHELBY: Now, in your statement -- I believe it's on page 28 -- not without reading it all -- and I'll quote some of it. It says, ""In April 2000, the intelligence community obtained information regarding an alleged bin Laden threat to hijack a 747. The source was a walk-in to the FBI's Newark office, claiming that he had been to a training camp in Pakistan, where he learned hijacking techniques and received arms training. He also stated that he was supposed to meet five or six other individuals in the U.S. who would participate in the plot."" And I'll read further: ""They were instructed to use all necessary force to take over the plane, because there would be pilots among the hijacking team. The plan was to fly the plane to Afghanistan, and if they could not make it there they would blow up the plane."" This is part of your report -- is that right? MS. HILL: Right. SEN. SHELBY: Now, were they -- I believe there was another report, August 2001, according to page 28 of your report, ""In August of 2001, the intelligence community obtained information regarding a plot to either bomb the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi from an airplane, or crash an airplane into it. The intelligence community learned that two people who were reportedly acting on instructions from bin Laden met in October 2000 to discuss this plot."" And then we go back and you've touched on this, I believe. I know we've had hearings on it. About the Philippine '95 situation. MS. HILL: Right. SEN. SHELBY: Where there was information that they could use airplanes as weapons and so forth. MS. HILL: Right, correct. SEN. SHELBY: In the light of part of your statement I just referred to , you're saying that they're -- according to your investigation, there was not any analysis of these terrorist tactics in the intelligence community, regarding the -- MS. HILL: There was no -- there was no analysis of the likelihood of the use of airplanes as weapons as a terrorist tactic. SEN. SHELBY: I wonder why not. MS. HILL: I would hypothesize that what -- I mean when we we've asked questions of people. It's a resource issue. People say they were overwhelmed. The other thing, and I mentioned this earlier, I don't think anyone had pulled as we did, I mean the reason, the way we got this information is by going to the agencies and saying we want everything you have on the use of aircraft as weapons. So we have then pulled out of this huge amount of data they have and come up with enough to show that there was this trend and this theme going through some of the reporting. SEN. SHELBY: This was not on September 11th something new or shouldn't have been something new. This was stuff that had been out there at least since '95, before then, and I believe you talked about the Paris incident where the French -- MS. HILL: The Eiffel Tower. SEN. SHELBY: Oh, yeah, the Eiffel Tower deal, the Philippine deal, these reporting that you listed. So when people come up and they say, ""Gosh, we were shocked that they would use weapons, use airplanes as weapons, and we didn't do any analysis of that in the community,"" are you kind of shocked or surprised? MS. HILL: Well, it was there. I mean, the information was there. SEN. SHELBY: The information was there if they had it analyzed as far as the potential tactics of the hijackers, is that right? MS. HILL: Yeah. I mean, based on what we've seen this was not a new idea as of September 11th. SEN. SHELBY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. SEN. GRAHAM: Senator Durbin. SEN. RICHARD DURBIN (D-IL): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I apologize for not being here earlier, but I had a Judiciary Committee hearing, which ran in conflict with this hearing today. And I thank you, Mr. Chairman, Senator Shelby and our counterparts in the House for the time that we put into this effort and your leadership in bringing us to this moment. I personally feel that we have identified some things of value in terms of shortcomings from the government's point of view prior to September 11th. We have identified a lack of communication among the intelligence agencies, and I'm afraid that today, although there's been an improvement, there is still much room for improvement. I have focused primarily on the issue of information technology and I have been chagrined and disappointed by the reports about the lack of coordination of the computer architecture of the federal government so that agencies, intelligence agencies can share information effectively. Governor Ridge referred to this as a force multiplier, and it would be, but it is not because of those shortcomings. We have also considered the results of those shortcomings, and not the least of which was the example of the Phoenix memo, which should have been but was not brought to the attention of or analyzed by counter-terrorism forces. That memo might -- might have at least helped us to be better prepared for what occurred on September 11th, though I don't want to suggest that anyone saw this coming in its specifics, but it's certainly raised questions, which should have been pursued and were not. I think recalling some of the testimony we received there was clearly a lack of follow-up at the FBI and a lack of involvement by the CIA. The same thing holds true for the Moussaoui arrest and the disclosures that came out of the FBI afterwards, again evidencing a lack of coordination, a lack of sharing of vital information that could have had us better prepared to defend America. Those two instances though I would like to bring to the attention of this joint inquiry have come to the public eye because of leaks, leaks by the administration, leaks from Capitol Hill of vital information. It strikes me as unwise and unfair for us to expect there to be a thorough investigation of what led up to September 11th based on the possibility of leaks coming from anywhere. History has told us that it is far better to have a public hearing, a public investigation and the involvement of third parties when it comes to assigning blame and perhaps suggesting meaningful and painful reforms, but that has not been the case here. I think we are doing what we set out to do, to try to find ways to improve the workings of the intelligence community to avoid a future September 11th, but we will never be able to satisfy the needs and curiosity of the American people about whether their government did everything it could to protect them in closed hearings with occasional leaks. That is not going to serve the needs of America. (Applause.) I know that earlier today there was testimony of one of the widows of a victim of September 11th and I have met in my office with some of those same victims and the families in painful meetings. There is an anger and a sadness in the message that they bring to Congress, but there is certainly I think wisdom in what they've suggested: Let us do our business here, let us try to find even within closed hearings ways to improve the intelligence committee and community, but let's not forget our primary obligation to the people of this country. We do not serve the needs of an open society with closed hearings in relation to an attack on America virtually unprecedented in our history. It is time for us to acknowledge the obvious: We need a third party investigation, people that we can trust, who have no political animus, who are going to come to this as loyal Americans to try to help us be a safer nation. I commend the staff. They have done heroic work and I know have worked long and hard to bring the report that we have today. And we should continue to meet our mandate as best we can, but let us not believe that this chapter has been closed in American history. We have merely addressed the forward with this investigation; now we must get into the substance and do it in a public way. That's not to diminish any of the efforts of my colleagues or anyone on this committee, but I think we owe it to the American people to give them more. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. SEN. GRAHAM: I would like to ask a question and then make a comment. The question has to do with the relationship between intelligence and effecting the operation of a governmental agency. You have five or more pages in which you outline the examples of the use of commercial aviation as a weapon of mass destruction. As I understand the history, generally the taking of an airplane by hijackers has been done for either a political or an economic purpose, that in light of that the standard protocol, what a crew is supposed to do if they are subjected to hijacking is to cooperate, to acquiesce, to try to get the airplane on the ground and then start the process of negotiating with the hijackers. From your review, is that an accurate statement? MS. HILL: Yes, I think that's correct, and that was traditionally the way you would deal with a hijacking. SEN. GRAHAM: And I believe it was reflected in the way in which the first three planes that were hijacked on September 11th reacted. It was not until the information of the first three planes became known to the persons on the fourth plane that there was a resistance to the hijackers and as a result the plane crashed in Pennsylvania. With the kind of intelligence information that there might be a shift in the way in which hijackers and aircraft interrelated, that is instead of taking the airplane for a political or economic purpose, that the plane itself might be converted into a weapon and used in the horrific manner that it was. Was that information from the intelligence community transmitted to either the FAA or the commercial aviation industry so that it might affect the way in which they advise crews as to how to respond to a hijacking? MS. HILL: I can't say that all that information was transmitted to the FAA. The FAA did get some of it, and we talk about their analysis of the threat to civil aviation. My own read on it is I don't think that to the extent the FAA got the information there was a real recognition that this was a serious threat. I mean, certainly you're correct. I mean, if they had changed their focus from hijacking for ransom or to take the plane and fly it somewhere else or hostages or whatever, if that had changed to the use of an aircraft as a weapon, you would have had to change the entire mindset and training that was given to the flight crews, for instance, and the security in the plane and everything, and that obviously did not happen because as of September 11th, you're absolutely correct, it didn't happen on September 11th until evidently the passengers in the fourth plane became aware of what was going on, but that was not, the flight crews up to that point I assume were following the standard protocol for dealing with a hijacking. But that issue underscores the importance of someone recognizing in the community, the intelligence community that this was a serious threat and there was a stream of information there and that perhaps it was serious enough and the likelihood was serious enough that they needed to address not only disseminating it but telling policymakers in those other agencies that this was a threat they now had to be prepared to meet. SEN. GRAHAM: One of my criticisms of the threats that are being issued to the general public, including the one within the last two weeks, is that what's lacking is the follow-on of what is the citizen who receives this information that they're living in a heightened threat environment supposed to do to protect themselves, their families, their communities. And here we have a case of where intelligence information was sent to a sophisticated industry, commercial aviation apparently without any direction as to how the industry should use the information and the consequence was they didn't use the information and that contributed to what happened on September 11th. I'd like to ask if we might pursue that issue, because I think it is a metaphor for the larger issue of how do you get intelligence from the theoretical to actually affecting the way people function and how they use that information to reduce their vulnerability to a particular threat. Senator Feinstein? SENATOR FEINSTEIN: I think Senator DeWine was before me, Mr. Chairman. SEN. GRAHAM: Oh, I'm sorry. Senator DeWine. I'm sorry. SEN. DEWINE: Mr. Chairman, I don't have any further questions. Thank you. SEN. GRAHAM: Senator Feinstein? SEN. FEINSTEIN: May I, Mr. Chairman? Ms. Hill? MS. HILL: Yes, Senator. SEN. FEINSTEIN: I wanted to kind of follow-up on where I was trying to go with this. The year 2001 was a very big year in the early spring with a lot of pieces of intelligence coming in. In reading your report, the year 1998 also appears to have been a very big year for all kinds of pieces. And I wanted to see if we couldn't go into some of those pieces a little bit more. There contained on page 15 on your written statement you talk about the use of fronts for terrorist activities, talk about flying an aircraft loaded with explosives into an airport and detonating it. Al-Qaeda was trying to establish an operative cell within the United States. A bin Laden plot involving aircraft in New York and Washington. Recruiting a group of five to seven young men from the United States to travel to the Middle East for training. Reward money for assassinations of four top intelligence agency officers and on like that. And then, of course the war that was declared in the CIA. MS. HILL: Right. SEN. FEINSTEIN: Can you go into any more detail on any of these individual pieces of intelligence and how they were used from an intelligence perspective to try to weave an intelligence web? Because it seems to me with this and then unfortunately in July of 2001 with the Phoenix memo and then in August with Moussaoui, and I don't know what was in his computer or in his possession, but I would suggest if you took those pieces and the other pieces one might be able to weave together a rather significant scheme. Can you give us any more information? MS. HILL: I can't. I don't think I can give you more information on the actual report because, as I mentioned at the outset, the language that we have in this statement is what has been declassified. So to venture beyond that language, that is the language that the declassification group basically signed off on as suitable for public release. I can't go into much more detail about the language of the report. We did go on some of these to the FBI and asked them what they did with some of this information or what happened to it when the report came in, if they got it, and I can tell you some of them, and we've given them a whole list, and some we still have not gotten responses. They are still trying to find out what they did or locate the record. Others they have found. For instance, I think you mentioned the 1998 information concerning a bin Laden plot involving aircraft in New York and Washington. The FBI, I can tell you, did receive that information and they worked actually with local law enforcement to try to verify the report, but they were not able to corroborate the report and took no further action is what we have been told. In September '98 we had one where we did get a response from the FBI. This was the one about that they obtained information that bin Laden's next operation could involve flying an aircraft loaded with explosives into a U.S. airport and detonating it. We asked the FBI if they got that information and what did they do with it. They did receive the information and they also worked with another agency, government agency to try to verify the information. The source of the information said that another individual had advanced knowledge of some of bin Laden's operations and had given him the information about bin Laden's attack or this report. The FBI tells us that they tried to work with other agencies and did verify portions of this account, but they were not able to locate the individual who reportedly had the advanced knowledge. And after September 11th they actually went back to this report and tried to locate that individual again and were unable to do so. So what we tried to do when we got these reports that we felt were significant was we tried -- particularly the ones, there were many in 1998 involving domestic U.S. attacks and on those we went back to the FBI, as I said, and have asked them, ""Did you get the report, what did you do to verify it or did you take any action,"" and they have come back to us on some of them. Some of them, there are a number of them, they are still trying to go through their records and come up with an answer as to whether they got it and if so what they did with it. But those two are examples of the type of thing we're getting from them. SEN. FEINSTEIN: Thank you. Mr. Chairman, just one quick comment, if I might. I think this report becomes kind of a basic primer on 9/11. I'm sure more will be filled in as time goes on, but I find it a very valuable document in establishing a chronology of what was known, when it was known, the fragmentary messages that come through here and my hope is as these hearings go on and particularly when we get to the Phoenix memo and the Moussaoui case that we might be able to ask some questions and I don't know in public session if we will about if there had been a FISA warrant on Moussaoui and the information made available, whether that would have been substantial enough to really ring a very strong bell. But I wanted to thank the staff and Ms. Hill and also thank the victims who were here today. It's very special and I hope you know that we really do care and that you really do have our sympathy and our determination to get at the heart of it. SEN. GRAHAM: And, Senator, I share those comments and I would say that within the next week or ten days we will have a further specific hearing on the issues that surround the Moussaoui case and that would be a very excellent opportunity to bore in at the level of detail that you've indicated your interested in. I didn't get a chance in my first round to make my comments, so I will do so unless anyone -- does anyone have any remaining questions? So this will be the last word. To me, one of the lessons that we have been learning and today we learned it at a new depth is how difficult it is to get an organization, which has been doing its business, important business in a particular pattern for an extended period of time, to be flexible enough to recognize that the environment has shifted and it is going to have to change its pattern of business. In the case of the intelligence agencies they were a child born in 1947 and grew up in the Cold War. Every experience that the U.S. intelligence service had was a post-1947 experience because we didn't have any civilian intelligence service in the United States prior to 1947. I contrast that with, for instance, the British who have had an intelligence service since the Napoleonic Wars. So it is not surprising that when the Cold War ended the agencies continued to act pretty much the way they did while the Cold War was still underway because that was the only environment in which they'd ever functioned or known. We've had some examples I think in the report that Ms. Hill has given us today, the difficulty in reestablishing priority. Even though we declared that terrorism and Osama bin Laden specifically was such an adversary that we were at war with him, we didn't change resources commensurate with that decision. We did not recognize that terrorism was now becoming a domestic threat because historically we thought of terrorism as something that happened abroad and the new creative uses that the hijackers were about to make of commercial airliners. No longer were they passive instruments to try to use to secure money or some political advantage; they had themselves become a weapon of mass destruction. So I see as one of our challenges as we move from what we are learning to what we are going to prescribe for the future is to how can we build in to our intelligence community a greater capability of internal adapting. We certainly don't want to leave this issue for the future that will require a repetition of September the 11th to get to grab us by the sleeves and say, you know, you've got to change because your old ways are threatening the security of the American people. And how we go about doing that I suggest will be one of our major tasks, and if we are successful one of our major accomplishments. If there is no further statement, as I indicated earlier, the record will be open for 48 hours if anyone has any additional material they would like to submit. I want to especially thank the families who are represented here today and especially to Kristen, who I see is still with us and also Stephen for their excellent presentations, which started our public hearings with the appropriate recognition of why we are here, and we are here because of you. Thank you. SEN. SHELBY: Mr. Chairman, what's the schedule for the rest of the week? SEN. GRAHAM: Ms. Hill, do you want to review tomorrow? MS. HILL: I believe tomorrow we are going to have a public hearing in this room beginning at 10:00 and there will be two panels of users of intelligence products from the intelligence community and those users will be senior government officials over several administrations. I believe tomorrow we will have Mr. Wolfowitz, the deputy secretary of defense, Mr. Armitage, the deputy secretary of state, Brent Scowcroft, former National Security Advisory, Tony Lake, former National Security Advisory, and Sandy Berger, former National Security Advisor. SEN. SHELBY.: Will we start at 10:00? MS. HILL: 10:00. SEN. GRAHAM: We'll start at 10:00 and assuming that the stars line up properly and we can accomplish this, our goal would be to complete the first panel, which will be Mr. Wolfowitz and Mr. Armitage, in approximately three hours, have a break and then return at 2:30 and have the second panel run approximately another -- I'm corrected. The second panel is going to start at 2:00 so that we can try to finish at approximately 5:00 with both panels. MS. HILL: That's correct. SEN. GRAHAM: Are we at a point, Ms. Hill, we can comment on Friday yet? MS. HILL: I think we're still engaged in ongoing discussions on Friday. SEN. GRAHAM: Okay, thank you. The hearing is adjourned. END. PANEL II OF A JOINT HEARING OF THE SENATE AND HOUSE SELECT INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE SUBJECT: EVENTS SURROUNDING SEPTEMBER 11TH CO-CHAIRED BY: SENATOR DONALD GRAHAM (D-FL); AND REP.

HILL: Good morning, senator. Good morning, Chairman Graham, Chairman Goss, members of these committees. Before I proceed with my statement, I have a long written statement which I would like to submit for the record, and I am going to orally summarize it, given the length of what we have here. SEN. GRAHAM: Your full statement will appear in the record. MS. HILL: Thank you. But before I get into the main part of the statement, I do want to make clear to you and members of the committee that the information that is in this statement that we are going to present this morning has been cleared for public release. And, as I think most of you know, much of the information that our staff has been working on over the last several months is obviously highly classified, or has been highly classified. In the course of the last two months, we have been working with the intelligence community in a long, and what I would call a very arduous process, to declassify much of the information that we have reviewed and that we believe is important to the public's understanding of why the intelligence community did not know of the September 11th attacks in advance. And I would point out that that process -- we want to say for the record that we appreciate the many long hours that have been put into that process, in what I believe for the most part has been very constructive cooperation with the executive branch on that process. A good number of professionals from the community have been in working groups and have gone over with our staff the details of this information, to put it in a form where it could be released publicly. So there have -- we have made very good progress. But I do need to report that by late last night we were able to resolve all but two issues about relevant information -- two issues where we believed relevant information to the inquiry has not yet, despite our discussions with the executive branch, been declassified. And I want to make reference to those two issues, because this statement has been prepared, recognizing that those two areas remain classified. The two areas are any references to the intelligence community providing information to the president or the White House, and the identity of and information on a key al Qaeda leader involved in the September 11th attacks. According to the White House and the DCI, director of central intelligence, the president's knowledge of intelligence information relevant to this inquiry remains classified, even when the substance of that intelligence information has been declassified. With respect to the key al Qaeda leader involved in the September 11th attacks, I am advised this morning that the White House, and not the DCI, has declined to declassify his identity, despite an enormous volume of media reporting on this individual that has been out there for some time. The joint inquiry staff disagrees on both of those issues. We believe the public has an interest in this information, and that public disclosure would not harm national security. However, as I believe you know, we do not have the independent authority to declassify intelligence information short of a lengthy procedure in the U.S. Congress. And we therefore have prepared this statement without detailed descriptions of our work in those two areas. REP. TIM ROEMER (D-IN): Mr. Chairman? A parliamentary inquiry. SEN. GRAHAM: Mr. Roemer. REP. ROEMER: Are the committees bound by the classification decisions made in these two instances? SEN. GRAHAM: It is our advice from staff director and counsel that we do not independently have the authority to declassify material, and therefore we are constrained by the decisions made by those who have that legal responsibility. REP. ROEMER: A further parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Chairman. Is there a process then that either the committee or the Congress can undertake to challenge a classification decision such as that? SEN. GRAHAM: The answer is yes. And I would like -- Ms. Hill alluded to the fact that there was such a process. I think she described it as being cumbersome. If you or counsel might briefly explain what the option is to Congress. MS. HILL: Mr. Chairman, I am not an expert on the committee process. As I understand it, from speaking with the full committee counsel on this, it is -- it would require the Congress to -- you would have to have a vote -- I am not sure the full Congress or the Senate or House -- but there's a vote involved. You would have to run it through. The Congress itself would have to override that classification decision. The reason that we did not originate this information under the classification decision, the agency that originates it makes the classification and declassifies it. And in this instance that would not be the Congress. So the only alternative would be to go through this rather what I am told is a lengthy, rather prolonged process. I should point out that right before the hearing this morning I was advised by the White House that they were going to look at these two issues again, and they thought they would review it again within the next 48 hours. And I advised them that if their position changes please to advise the committees, and we could always issue a supplemental statement on those two issues for the record. So I -- my assumption is they are still reviewing it. REP. ROEMER: A final parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Chairman. Does the chairman intend to have this committee consider or debate that kind of process? I am not advocating that we challenge it at this point, but certainly understanding more from the joint inquiry staff that strongly disagrees with the decision as to why it might be helpful in a deliberative sense for the committee? SEN. GRAHAM: I think there are two questions in your inquiry. One is whether we might consider utilizing the currently existing process in this or future instances in which we have a disagreement as to whether the information which is being withheld is in fact classified information; i.e., that it relates to the national security. The second question might be as part of our final report we might want to recommend to our colleagues a change in the law that relates to the congressional role in declassification, so that it would be more available as an alternative in the event that there was a disagreement between Congress and an executive classifying agency. REP. ROEMER: Well, Mr. Chairman, thank you. I hope we do have a robust discussion of this, and I appreciate your patience. REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): Mr. Chairman? SEN. GRAHAM: Yes, Ms. Pelosi? REP. PELOSI: Mr. Chairman, I wish -- thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to join you in your earlier comments commending Eleanor Hill and Rick Sikagon (ph) and the joint inquiry staff for their fine work. And I want to inquire if it's possible just on this point, that the parliamentary inquiry that Mr. Roemer brought up. If Ms. Hill could just clarify -- it says any reference to the intelligence community providing information to the president or the White House. Could you give us an example of that? MS. HILL: What we are referring to, it's obvious and it's clear as you go through this statement that I am about to present, that we are talking about a number of intelligence reports which we have had declassified through this process. And part of our role was not just looking at what was the reporting, but where the reporting went. And you will note that this statement includes many intelligence reports, and in some instances they were provided to ""senior government officials,"" I believe is the wording that's used. But there is no reference on any of the pages as to whether the president received that information or not. And we have been told that that information -- in other words, not what is in the report but whether or not it went to the president -- would be classified under this decision. REP. PELOSI: And when you say the president, you mean any president historically. MS. HILL: That's correct. And clearly, if you look at the statement, the reporting has dates on it and the reporting is not just reporting that would have been under the current administration, but also reporting that was made under the prior administration. And the decision, in fairness, obviously, to the White House, it is not simply as to this sitting president but as to any president. REP. PELOSI: Well, I would hope, Mr. Chairman, whoever is presiding here, that Mr. Roemer's comments will be taken seriously by the chairman and that the committee should consider their options under existing committee rules to make this information public, depending on how it goes in the next 48 hours. And I would -- I think that the White House should be aware that there is strong interest among many of us to have this be the most open process possible, in fairness to those families who were affected, we heard from this morning, and really in the interest of a democratic society. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. REP. LAHOOD: Mr. Chairman? REP. GOSS: Chairman Graham had to step out for a moment; he'll be back. But I assure you, Ms. Pelosi, that he will be attentive to that request, as will I. Is it a point of inquiry or on this matter? REP. LAHOOD: On this matter. REP. GOSS: Mr. LaHood. REP. LAHOOD: Mr. Chairman, I wonder if the two chairmen could approach the White House within the next 48 hours, since they have this under consideration, to encourage them to make this information public and to relay the will of -- I believe it's the will of the joint committee that, based on what our staff director has said, that this information is important to be released. And it sounds like they're trying to make a political decision. And we would -- the joint committee would encourage them to release the information. I say that because it's under consideration, and I think it's important, particularly given the testimony that was provided by the first two witnesses. Thank you. REP. GOSS: Thank you, Mr. LaHood. I assure you that this is not a matter of first impression for the two chairmen or actually the four of us. We have made this case before. And just so all members of the committee and the public will know, there are approximately generalized areas that we feel there is legitimacy to withhold information to the public. Otherwise we feel the burden is on to the administration to prove to us why we should not give it to the public. We take the position the public deserves it. Those three exceptions are, of course, sources and methods, particularly those still active; plans and intentions -- that would be involving any actions we might take which might put our personnel at harm by giving advance information about what they're up to; and the third area is in the active prosecutions ongoing by the Department of Justice. We don't want to in any way mess up a prosecution that is going forward by saying something inadvertent that would create a problem for the prosecution. I think, other than those three areas, the public has a right to know and a need to know, because part of the reason we're going public hear is the awareness curve of what this enemy looks like, what they can do to us, and why we need to have a better system and why we are going to be asking for the support of our constituency, the American people, to give us a better intelligence system and all that that means. I hope that's a satisfactory answer. And your request is duly noted and will be dealt with. Would you please proceed after I advise the members that we have about 12 minutes left on a vote in the House? Is it one vote or two? Do we know? I believe it is one vote. Do members of the Senate wish to continue? SEN. FEINSTEIN: Mr. Chairman? Mr. Chairman? REP. GOSS: Yes, Senator. SEN. FEINSTEIN: Might I ask a question? Will there be a brief recess over the lunch hour for those of us that have commitments? REP. GOSS: It had been intended that there would not be, and I would suggest that when Senator Graham comes back, that you confer with him on that. The members of the House are now going to vote, and we will be away for about 20 minutes. And perhaps in that time you can decide how you wish to carry forward. SEN. SHELBY: Mr. Chairman, do you want us to wait and suspend the hearing? Because you won't have the benefit of her testimony. REP. GOSS: What is the view of the members? Do you want them to suspend or -- SEN. SHELBY: Till you get back. I think so. SEN. GRAHAM: The hearing will suspend until the members of the House return. (Recess.) SEN. GRAHAM: Call the hearing back to order. Ms. Eleanor Hill was in the early stages of providing us with the report of the joint inquiry staff. For purposes of people's schedules, it is our plan after Ms. Hill completes her statement to them call upon members in the order in which they arrived for five minutes of either questions or comments. I recognize that we will be running through the lunch hour. If members have to leave for previous commitments, or the pangs of hunger become overwhelming, they are encouraged to do so, but also encouraged to return so that they can have their opportunity to ask questions or make their comments. Ms. Hill. MS. HILL: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. SEN. FEINSTEIN: Excuse me. Mr. Chairman, could you read the list so we might know where we are? SEN. GRAHAM: Yes ma'am. The -- after the -- the chairs and vice chairs, they are in this order: Senator DeWine, Congressman Boehlert, Senator Wyden, Congressman Bereuter, Congressman Bishop, Senator Levin, Senator Inhofe, Congressman Peterson, Congressman Cramer, Congressman Boswell, Congressman Castle, Congressman Roemer, Congresswoman Harman, Congressman Burr, Senator Bayh, Senator Rockefeller, Senator Feinstein, Senator Mikulski, Congressman LaHood, Congressman Hoekstra, Senator Edwards, Congressman Gibbons, Congressman Everett. SEN. INHOFE (?): Mr. Chairman? SEN. GRAHAM: Yes. SEN. INHOFE (?): Would it be appropriate to ask unanimous consent of the members that if individuals do have to leave, if they have statements, that they could be included as part of the record. SEN. GRAHAM: It will be included in the record. SEN INHOFE (?): I thank the chair. SEN. GRAHAM: Are there any other comments before we return to Ms. Hill? Ms. Hill. MS. HILL: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Before I forget, I do want to ask that we have two versions of this statement -- it's the same statement but we have two copies, one of which has been signed and certified as releasable, cleared for public release by the chair of the declassification working group for the intelligence community, and each page has been initialed by that individual. And the second copy that I would also like to make available and part of the record is a similar copy that was signed and certified by the representative of the Department of Justice and initialed indicating that they agreed and concurred that it was suitable for public release, because, as you know, the Justice Department has some litigation concerns, ongoing cases. So, I'd ask that those be made part of the record. SEN. GRAHAM: Without objection. MS. HILL: Okay. I appreciate the opportunity to appear here today to advise the committees and the American public on the progress to date of the joint inquiry staff's review of the activities of the U.S. intelligence community in connection with the September 11th terrorist attacks on the United States. As the horror and sheer inhumanity of that day engulfed this nation, all of us struggled with shock, with the utter disbelief, and the inevitable search for answers. The questions, if not the answers, were obvious. How could we have been so surprised? What did our government, especially our intelligence agencies, know before September 11th, 2001? Why didn't they know more? What can we do to strengthen and improve the capabilities of our intelligence agencies and as a result help save ourselves and our children from ever having to face this again? On February 14th, 2002, the leadership of these two committees announced their resolve to come together to find credible answers to those sobering but critically important questions. The committees joined in an unprecedented, bicameral and bipartisan joint inquiry effort to meet that challenge. To conduct the review, the committees assembled a single staff that we call the joint inquiry staff, of 24 highly skilled professionals with experience in such areas as intelligence collection, analysis, management, law enforcement, investigations, and oversight. My testimony this morning is intended to address the inquiry's initial task, which was to conduct a factual review of what the intelligence community knew, or should have known, prior to September 11th, 2001, regarding the international terrorist threat to the United States. I caution that the inquiry remains a work in progress, and that we may be developing additional relevant information as our work continues. That being said, we feel it is important to share with the American people, through these hearings, what we have found through our efforts to date. Let me briefly describe the way in which we have approached this review. We decided to target our search on categories of information that would most likely yield any intelligence material of relevance to the September 11th attacks. Specifically, our teams requested and reviewed from the intelligence community agencies these categories of information: any information obtained before September 11th suggesting that an attack on the United States was imminent and what was done with it; any information obtained before September 11th that should have alerted the intelligence community to this kind of attack, that is, using airplanes to attack buildings, and what was done with it; any information obtained before September 11th about the 19 dead hijackers and what was done with it; and any information obtained after September 11th about the hijackers and their backgrounds, including their involvement with al Qaeda, entry into this country, and activities while in this country, as well as why they never came to the attention of the United States government. And I would point out on the issue of the hijackers that we do intend -- we will not address that this morning, but we do intend to have an additional statement at subsequent hearings that are focused on that issue. As part of its review of the evolution of the international terrorist threat against the United States, the joint inquiry staff produced a chronology that began in 1982 and ends on September 11th, 2001, and that chronology, I believe, has been reproduced and handed out, and is also depicted on these charts here in the room this morning. And I would request that the chronology also be made part of the record. SEN. GRAHAM: Without objection, so ordered. MS. HILL: The chronology notes significant events in international terrorism, significant counter-terrorist actions that were taken by the U.S. government in response to the threat, and information received by the intelligence community that was potentially relevant to the September 11th attacks. The chronology underscores several points regarding with the U.S. government, specifically the intelligence community, knew about the international terrorist threat to the United States and U.S. interests prior to September 11th, 2001, and these are those points. September 11th, while indelible in magnitude and in impact, was by no means America's first confrontation with international terrorism. While the nature of the threat has evolved and changed over time, it has long been recognized that United States interests were considered prime targets by various international terrorist groups. In response to a number of terrorist attacks on U.S. interests abroad during the 1980s, the U.S. government initiated a focused effort on terrorism -- against terrorism -- including the establishment by the director of central intelligence, William Casey, of the Counter-Terrorism Center, or CTC at CIA headquarters in 1986. In 1996, 10 years later, the FBI created its own counter-terrorism center at FBI headquarters. Both in terms of attempts and actual attacks, there was considerable historical evidence prior to September 11th that international terrorists had planned, and were in fact capable of conducting major terrorist strikes within the United States. The 1993 attack on the World Trade Center, the subsequent discovery in 1993 of plots to bomb New York City landmarks, and the arrest in 1999, during the millennium, of an individual with al Qaeda connections intending to bomb Los Angeles International Airport should have erased any doubts, to the extent they existed, about that point. From 1994 through as late as August 2001, the intelligence community had received information indicating that international terrorists had seriously considered the use of airplanes as a means of carrying out terrorist attacks. While this method of attack had clearly been discussed in terrorist circles, there was apparently little, if any effort, by intelligence community analysts to produce any strategic assessments of terrorists using aircraft as weapons. Osama Bin Laden's role in international terrorism came to the attention of the intelligence community in the early 1990s. While bin Laden was initially viewed as a financier of terrorism, by 1996, the intelligence community was aware of his involvement in directing terrorist acts and had begun actively collecting intelligence on him. Bin Laden's own words indicated a steadily escalating threat. In August 1996, Osama Bin Laden issued a public fatwah or religious decree authorizing attacks on Western military targets in the Arabian Peninsula. In February 1998, bin Laden issued another public fatwah authorizing and promoting attacks on U.S. civilians and military personnel anywhere in the world. Following the August 1998 bombings of two U.S. embassies in East Africa, intelligence community leadership recognized how dangerous bin Laden's network was. In December 1998, director of central intelligence, George Tenet, provided written guidance to his deputies at the CIA, declaring, in effect, a, quote, ""war"" with bin Laden. While counter-terrorism was a resource priority from the time of the DCI's statement onward, it was competing with several other intelligence priorities, such as non-proliferation. Despite the DCI's declaration of war in 1998, there was no massive shift in budget or reassignment of personnel to counter-terrorism until after September 11th, 2001. By late 1998, the intelligence community had amassed a growing body of information --though general in nature, and lacking specific details on time and on place -- indicating that bin Laden and the al Qaeda network intended to strike within the United States, and concern about bin Laden continued to grow over time and reached peak levels in the spring and summer of 2001, as the intelligence community faced increasing numbers of reports of imminent al Qaeda attacks against U.S. interests. In July and August 2001, that rise in intelligence reporting began to decrease, just as three additional developments occurred in the United States -- the Phoenix memo, the detention of Zacarias Moussaoui, and the intelligence community's realization that two individuals with ties to bin Laden's network, Khalid Al-Midhar and Nawaq Alhamzi, were possibly in the United States. The two individuals turned out to be two of the 19 hijackers on September 11th. The intelligence community apparently had not connected these individual warning flags to each other, to the drumbeat of threat reporting that had just occurred, or to the urgency of the war effort against bin Laden. Our review today provides further context for each of these points, and my written statement addresses in great detail each point. For purposes of this review, I am going to focus not on the historical sections but rather on our review of more recent intelligence reporting. And the first point in that regard would be intelligence reporting on bin Laden's intentions to strike inside the United States. Central to the September 11th plot was Osama Bin Laden's idea of carrying out a terrorist operation within the United States. It has been suggested that prior to September 11th, 2001, information available to the intelligence community had for the most part pointed to a terrorist threat against U.S. interests abroad. Our review confirmed that shortly after Osama Bin Laden's May 1998 press conference, the intelligence community began to acquire intelligence information indicating that bin Laden's network intended to strike within the United States. These intelligence reports, which I'll go through in a minute, should be understood in their proper context. First, they generally did not contain specific information as to where, when and how a terrorist attack might occur, and generally they are not corroborated by further information. Second, these reports represented a small percentage of the threat information that the intelligence community obtained during this period, most of which pointed to the possibility of attacks against U.S. interest overseas. Nonetheless, there was a modest but relatively steady stream of intelligence information indicating the possibility of terrorist attacks within the United States. Third, the credibility of the sources providing this information was sometimes questionable. While one could not as a result give too much credence to some individual reports, the totality of the information in the body of reporting clearly reiterated a consistent and critically important theme -- bin Laden's intent to launch terrorist attacks inside the United States. And I will summarize several of these reports -- and I should stress again, these are in declassified versions, they have been declassified. In June 1998, the intelligence community obtained information from several sources that bin Laden was considering attacks in the United States, including Washington, D.C. and New York. This information was provided to senior U.S. government officials in July 1998. In August 1998, the intelligence community obtained information that a group of unidentified Arabs planned to fly an explosive-laden plane from a foreign country into the World Trade Center. The information was passed to the FBI and the FAA. The FAA found the plot highly unlikely given the state of that foreign country's aviation program. Moreover, they believed that a flight originating outside the United States would be detected before it reached its intended target inside the United States. The FBI's New York office took no action on the information, filing the communication in the office's bombing repository file. The intelligence community has acquired additional information since then indicating there may be links between this group and other terrorist groups, including al Qaeda. In September 1998, the intelligence community prepared a memorandum detailing al Qaeda infrastructure in the United States, including the use of fronts for terrorist activities. This information was provided to senior U.S. government officials in September of 1998. In September of 1998, the intelligence community obtained information that bin Laden's next operation would possibly involve flying an aircraft loaded with explosives into a U.S. airport and detonating it. This information was provided to senior U.S. government officials in late 1998. In October 1998, the intelligence community obtained information that al Qaeda was trying to establish and operative cell within the United States. This information indicated there might be an effort underway to recruit U.S. citizen Islamists and U.S.-based expatriates from the Middle East and North Africa. In the fall of 1998, the intelligence community received information concerning a bin Laden plot involving aircraft in the New York and Washington, D.C. areas. In November 1998, the intelligence community obtained information that a bin Laden terrorist cell was attempting to recruit a group of five to seven young men from the United States to travel to the Middle East for training. This was in conjunction with planning to strike U.S. domestic targets. In November of 1998, the intelligence community received information that bin Laden and senior associates had agreed to allocate reward money for the assassinations of four top intelligence agency officers. The bounty for each assassination was $9 million. The bounty was in response to the U.S. announcement of an increase in the reward money for information leading to the arrest of bin Laden. In the spring of 1999, the intelligence community obtained information about a planned bin Laden attack on a U.S. government facility in Washington, D.C.. In August 1999, the intelligence community obtained information that bin Laden's organization had decided to target the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense and the Director of Central Intelligence. ""Target"" was interpreted by intelligence community analysts to mean assassinate. In September 1999 the intelligence community obtained information that bin Laden and others were planning a terrorist act in the United States, possibly against specific landmarks in California and New York City. The reliability of the source of this information was unknown. In late 1999 the intelligence community obtained information regarding the bin Laden network's possible plans to attack targets in Washington, DC and New York City during the New York's millennium celebration. On December 14th, 1999 an individual named Ahmed Ressam was arrested as he attempted to enter the United States from Canada. An alert U.S. Customs Service officer in Fort Washington stopped Ressam and asked to search his vehicle. Chemicals and detonator materials were found in his car. Ressam's intended target was Los Angeles International Airport. In February 2000 the intelligence community obtained information that bin Laden was making plans to assassinate U.S. intelligence officials, including the director of the FBI. In March 2000 the intelligence community obtained information regarding the types of targets that operatives in bin Laden's network might strike. The Statue of Liberty was specifically mentioned, as were skyscrapers, ports, airports, and nuclear power plants. In March 2000 the intelligence community obtained information indicating bin Laden was planning attacks in specific West Coast areas, possibly involving the assassination of several public officials. The intelligence community had concerns that this information might have come from a source known to fabricate information. And in April 20001 the intelligence community obtained information from a source with terrorist connections, who speculated that bin Laden would be interested in commercial pilots as potential terrorists. The source warned that the United States should not focus only on embassy bombings, that terrorists sought, quote, ""spectacular and traumatic,"" closed quotes, attacks and that the first World Trade Center bombing would be the type of attack that would be appealing. The source did not mention a timeframe for any attack. Because the source was offering personal speculation and not hard information, the information was not disseminated within the intelligence community. Bin Laden's declaration of war in 1998 and intelligence reports indicating possible terrorist plots inside the United States did not go unnoticed by the intelligence community, which, in turn, advised senior officials in the U.S. government of the serious nature of the threat. The staff has also reviewed documents other than individual intelligence reports that demonstrate that at least at senior levels the intelligence community understood that bin Laden posed a serious threat to the domestic United States. Here are five examples: A December 1st, 1998 intelligence community assessment of Osama bin Laden read in part, and I quote, ""UBL is actively planning against U.S. targets. Multiple reports indicate UBL is keenly interested in striking the U.S. on its own soil. Al-Qaeda is recruiting operatives for attacks in the U.S. but has not yet identified potential targets."" On December 4th, 1998 in a memorandum to his deputies at the CIA the director of Central Intelligence summed up the situation in this way, quote, ""We must now enter a new phased in our effort against bin Laden. Our work to date has been remarkable and in some instances heroic, yet each day we all acknowledge that retaliation is inevitable and that its scope may be far larger than we have previously experienced. We are at war. I want no resources or people spared in this effort either inside CIA or the community."" A classified document signed by a senior U.S. government official in December 1998 read in part, quote, ""The intelligence community has strong indications that bin Laden intends to conduct or sponsor attacks inside the United States."" In June 1999 testimony before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and in a July 1999 briefing to House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence staffers the chief of the CTC described reports that bin Laden and his associates were planning attacks in the United States. And a classified document signed by a senior U.S. government official in July 1999 characterized bin Laden's February 1998 statement as, quote, ""a de facto declaration of war,"" close quotes, on the United States. What is left clear is the extent to which other parts of the government, as well as the American people, understood and fully appreciated the gravity and the immediacy of the threat. For example, officials at the National Security Agency, whom we have interviewed, were aware of DCI Tenet's December 1998 declaration that the intelligence community was at war with bin Laden. On the other hand, relatively few of the FBI agents interviewed by the Joint Inquiry Staff seem to have been aware of DCI Tenet's declaration. There was also considerable variation in the degree to which FBI- led Joint Terrorism Task Forces or JTTF prioritized and coordinated field efforts targeting bin Laden and al-Qaeda. While the FBI's New York office was the lead office in the vast majority of counter- terrorism investigations concerning bin Laden, many other FBI offices around the country were unaware of the magnitude of the threat. There are also indications that the allocation of intelligence community resources after the DCI's December 1998 declaration did not adequately reflect a true war effort against bin Laden. In 1999 the CTC had only three analysts assigned full time to bin Laden's terrorist network worldwide. After 2000 but before September 11th, 2001, that number had risen to five. On a broader scale, our review has found little evidence prior to September 11th of a sustained national effort to mobilize public awareness and to harden the homeland against a potential assault by bin Laden within the United States, with the possible exception of a heightened focus on weapons of mass destruction. The second point that I want to cover is strategic warnings, indications of a possible terrorist attack in the spring and summer of 2001. Let me briefly describe what we have found regarding the level and the nature of threat information that was obtained by the intelligence community during the spring and summer of 2001. During that time period the community experienced a significant rise in information indicating that bin Laden and al-Qaeda intended to strike against United States interests in the very near future. Some individuals within the community have suggested that the increase in threat reporting was unprecedented, at least in terms of their own experience. While the reporting repeatedly predicted dire consequences for Americans, it did not provide actionable detail on when, where and how specific attacks would occur. Between late March and September 2001 the intelligence community detected numerous indicators of an impending terrorist attack, some of which pointed specifically to the United States as a possible target. In March 2001 an intelligence source claimed a group of bin Laden operatives were planning to conduct an unspecified attack in the United States in April 2001. One of the operatives allegedly resided within the United States. In April 2001 the intelligence community obtained information that unspecified terrorist operatives in California and New York State were planning a terrorist attack in those states for April. Between May and July the National Security Agency reported at least 33 communications indicating a possible imminent terrorist attack. None of these reports provided any specific information on where, when or how an attack might occur, nor was it clear that any of the individuals involved in these intercepted communications had any firsthand knowledge of where, when or how an attack might occur. If they did know, it was not evident in the intercept. These reports were widely disseminated within the intelligence community. In May 2001 the intelligence community obtained information that supporters of bin Laden were reportedly planning to infiltrate the United States via Canada in order to carryout a terrorist operation using high explosives. The report mentioned an attack within the United States though it did not say where in the U.S. or when or how an attack might occur. In July 2001 this information was shared with the FBI, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the U.S. Customs Service and the State Department and was included in a closely held intelligence report for senior government officials in August 2001. In May 2001 the Department of Defense acquired and shared with other elements of the intelligence community information indicating that seven individuals associated with bin Laden had departed various locations for Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States. In June 2001 the DCI's CTC had information that key operatives in Osama bin Laden's organization were disappearing while others were preparing for martyrdom. In July 2001 the DCI's CTC was aware of an individual who had recently been in Afghanistan, who had reported, quote, ""everyone is talking about an impending attack,"" close quotes. The intelligence community was also aware that bin Laden had stepped up his propaganda efforts in the preceding months. On August 16th, 2001, in Minneapolis, Minnesota the INS detained Zacarias Moussaoui. Prior to that date, in August 2001 Mr. Moussaoui's conduct had aroused suspicions about why he was learning to fly large commercial aircraft and had prompted the flight school he was attending in Minneapolis to contact the local FBI office. FBI agents believed that Moussaoui may have been intending to carry out a terrorist act. On August 23rd, 2001, the intelligence community requested that two individuals, Khalid al-Midhar and Nawaf Alhazmi, who had first come to the attention of the community in 1999 as possible associates of bin Laden's terrorist network, be added to the U.S. Department of State's watch list for denying visas to individuals attempting to enter the United States. Working levels of INS and U.S. Customs had determined that at least one of them was likely in the United States, prompting FBI headquarters to request searches for them in both New York and Los Angeles. The FBI's New York field office unsuccessfully searched for al- Midhar and Alhazmi. The FBI's Los Angeles office received the search request on September 11th, 2001. In late summer 2001 the intelligence community obtained information that an individual associated with al-Qaeda was considering mounting terrorist operations within the United States. There was no information available as to the timing of possible attacks or the alleged targets. And on September 10th, 2001 the NSA intercepted two communications between individuals abroad suggesting imminent terrorist activity. These communications were not translated into English and disseminated until September 12th, 2001. These intercepts did not provide any indication of where or what activities might occur. Despite these indicators of a possible terrorist attack inside the United States, during the course of interviews the joint inquiry staff was told that it was the general view of the U.S. intelligence community in the spring and summer of 2001 that an attack on U.S. interests was more likely to occur overseas. Individuals in the intelligence community pointed to intelligence information, the arrest of suspected terrorists in the Middle East and Europe, and a credible report of a plan to attack a U.S. Embassy in the Middle East as factors that shaped their thinking about where an attack was likely to occur. One senior FBI official said that based on the intelligence he was seeing, he thought there was a high probability, quote, ""98 percent,"" close quote, that the attack would occur overseas. During the summer of 2001, the intelligence community was also disseminating information through appropriate channels to senior U.S. government officials about possible terrorist attacks. For example, in June 2001, the community issued a terrorist threat advisory, warning U.S. government agencies that there was a high probability of an imminent terrorist attack against U.S. interests by Sunni extremists associated with bin Laden's al Qaeda organization. The advisory mentioned the Arabian peninsula, Israel and Italy as possible locations. According to the advisory, the community continued to believe that Sunni extremists associated with al Qaeda are most likely to attempt spectacular attacks, resulting in numerous casualties. Subsequently, intelligence information provided to senior government leaders indicated that bin Laden's organization expected near-term attacks to have dramatic consequences on government or cause major casualties. A briefing prepared for senior government officials at the beginning of July 2001 contained the following language, quote: ""Based on a review of all source reporting over the last five months, we believe that UBL will launch a significant terrorist attack against U.S. and/or Israeli interests in the coming weeks. The attack will be spectacular and designed to inflict mass casualties against U.S. facilities or interests. Attack preparations have been made. Attack will occur with little or no warning."" Later, intelligence information provided to senior government leaders indicated that bin Laden's organization continued to expect imminent attacks on U.S. interests. The joint inquiry staff has been advised by a representative of the intelligence community that about a month later, in August 2001, a closely-held intelligence report, for senior government officials, included information that bin Laden had wanted to conduct attacks in the United States since 1997. The information included discussion of the arrest of Ahmed Ressam in December 1999, and the 1998 bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. It mentioned that members of al Qaeda, including some U.S. citizens, had resided or traveled in or traveled to the United States for years, and that the group apparently maintained a support structure here. The report cited uncorroborated information obtained in 1998 that bin Laden wanted to hijack airplanes to gain the release of U.S.-held extremists. FBI judgments about patterns of activity, consistent with preparation of hijackings or other types of attacks, and the number of bin Laden number of investigations underway, as well as information acquired in May 2001 that indicated a group of bin Laden's supporters was planning attacks in the United States with explosives. In August 2001, based on information it had in its possession at the time, the CIA sent a message to the FAA, asking the FAA to advise corporate security directors of U.S. air carriers of the following information: Quote, ""A group of six Pakistanis currently based in Bolivia may be planning to conduct a hijacking, or possibly a bombing, or an act of sabotage against at commercial airliner. While we have no details of the carrier, the date or the location of this, or these possibly actions, we have learned the group has had discussions in which Canada, England, Malaysia, Cuba, South Africa, Mexico, Atlanta, New York, Madrid, Moscow and Dubai have come up, and India and Islamabad have been described as possible travel destinations,"" close quote. While this information was not related to an attack planned by al Qaeda, it did alert the aviation community to the possibility that a hijacking plot might occur in the U.S. shortly before the September 11th attacks occurred. Now I want to turn to intelligence information on possible terrorist use of airplanes as weapons. Central to the September 11th attack was the terrorist use of airplanes as weapons. In the aftermath of the attacks, there was much discussion about the extent to which our government was or could have been aware of the threat of terrorist attacks of this type, and the extent to which adequate precautions were taken to address the threat. Based on our review to date, we believe that the intelligence community was aware of the potential for this type of terrorist attack, but did not produce any specific assessments of the likelihood that terrorists would use airplanes as weapons. Our review has uncovered several examples of intelligence reporting on the possible use of airplanes as weapons in terrorist operations. In December 1994, Algerian Armed Islamic Group terrorists hijacked an Air France flight in Algiers, and threatened to crash it into the Eiffel Tower. French authorities deceived the terrorists into thinking the plane did not have enough fuel to reach Paris, and diverted it. A French anti-terrorist force stormed the plane and killed all four terrorists. In January 1995, a Philippine national police raid turned up materials in a Manila apartment indicating that three individuals planned, among other things, to crash a plane into CIA headquarters. The Philippine national police said that the same group was responsible for the bombing of a Philippine airliner on December 12th, 1994. Information on the threat was passed to the FAA, which briefed U.S. and major foreign carriers. In January 1996, the intelligence community obtained information concerning a planned suicide attack by individuals associated with Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman, and a key al Qaeda operative. The plan was to fly to the United States from Afghanistan, and attack the White House. In October 1996, the intelligence community obtained information regarding an Iranian plot to hijack a Japanese plane over Israel and crash it into Tel Aviv. An individual would board the plane in the Far East. During the flight he would commandeer the aircraft, order it to fly over Tel Aviv, and then crash the plane into the city. In 1997, one of the units at FBI headquarters became concerned about the possibility of a terrorist group using an unmanned aerial vehicle, UAV, for terrorist attack. The FBI and CIA became aware of reporting that this group had purchased a UAV. At the time the agency's view was that the only reason that this group would need a UAV would be for either reconnaissance or attack. There was more concern about the possibility of an attack outside the United States; for example, by flying the UAV into a U.S. Embassy or a visiting U.S. delegation. As noted previously, in August 1998, the intelligence community obtained information that a group of unidentified Arab planned to fly an explosive-laden plane from a foreign country into the World Trade Center. Also noted previously, in September '98, the intelligence community obtained information that bin Laden's next operation could possibly involve flying an aircraft loaded with explosives into a U.S. airport and detonating it. In November 1998, the community obtained information that a Turkish Islamic extremist group had planned a suicide attack to coincide with celebrations marking the death of Ataturk. The conspirators, who were arrested, planned to crash an airplane packed with explosives into Ataturk's tomb during a government ceremony. The Turkish press said the group had cooperated with Osama bin Laden. The FBI's New York office included this incident in one of its Osama bin Laden databases. In February 1999, the intelligence community obtained information that Iraq had formed a suicide pilot unit it planned to use against British and U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf. The CIA commented that this was highly unlikely, and probably disinformation. In March 1999, the intelligence community obtained information regarding a plan by an al Qaeda member who was a U.S. citizen to fly a hang glider into the Egyptian presidential palace, and then detonate the explosives he was carrying. The individual who received hang glider training in the United States brought the hang glider back to Afghanistan. In April 2000, the intelligence community obtained information regarding an alleged bin Laden plot to hijack a 747. The source, who was a walk-in to the FBI's Newark office, claimed that he had been to a training camp in Pakistan, where he learned hijacking techniques and received arms training. He also stated that he was supposed to meet five to six other individuals in the United States who would also participate in the plot. They were instructed to use all necessary force to take over the plane, because there would be pilots among the hijacking team. The plan was to fly the plane to Afghanistan, and if they could not make it there that they were to blow up the plane. Although the individual passed an FBI polygraph, the FBI was never able to verify any aspect of his story or identify his contacts in the United States. And, in August 2001, the intelligence community obtained information regarding a plot to either bomb the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi from an airplane, or crash an airplane into it. The intelligence community learned that two people who were reportedly acting on instructions from bin Laden met in October 2000 to discuss this plot. Despite these reports, the community did not produce any specific assessments of the likelihood that terrorists would use airplanes as weapons. This may have been driven in part by resource issues in the area of intelligence analysis. Prior to September 11th, 2001, the CTC had 40 analysts to analyze terrorism issues worldwide, with only one of the five branches focused on terrorist tactics. Prior to September 11th, 2001, the only terrorist tactic on which the CTC performed strategic analysis was the possible use of chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear weapons, because there were more obvious potential for mass casualties. At the FBI prior to September 11th, 2001, support for ongoing investigations and operations was favored in terms of resources over long-term strategic analysis. We were told during the course of our FBI interviews that prevention occurred in the operational unit, not through strategic analysis, and that prior to September 11th the FBI had insufficient resources to do both. We were also told that the FBI's al Qaeda related analytic expertise had been, quote, ""gutted,"" close quote, by transfers to operational units, and that as a result the FBI's analytic unit had only one individual working on al Qaeda at the time of the September 11 attacks. While focused strategic analysis was lacking, the subject of aviation related terrorism was included in some broader terrorist threat assessments, such as the National Intelligence Estimate on Terrorism. For example, the 1995 NIE on terrorism cited the consideration the Bojinka conspirators gave to attacking CIA headquarters with an aircraft. The document contained the following language: ""Our review of the evidence suggests that the conspirators were guided in the selection of the method and venue of the attack by carefully studying security procedures in place in the region. If terrorists operating in this country, the United States, are similarly methodical, they will identify serious vulnerabilities in the security system for domestic flights."" The 1997 update to that report on terrorism included the following language: ""Civil aviation remains a particularly attractive target, in light of the fear and publicity the downing of an airliner would evoke, and the revelations last summer of the U.S. air transport sector's vulnerabilities. In a December 2000 report, the FBI and the FAA published a classified assessment that suggested less concern about the threat to domestic aviation. Quote, ""FBI investigations confirm domestic and international terrorist groups operating within the United States, but do not suggest evidence of plans to target domestic civil aviation. Terrorist activity within the U.S. has focused primarily on fundraising, recruiting new members, and disseminating propaganda. While international terrorists have conducted attacks on U.S. soil, these acts represent anomalies in their traditional targeting, which focused on U.S. interests overseas."" After September 11th, 2001, the CIA belatedly acknowledged some of the information that was available and has been available regarding the use of airplanes as weapons. A draft analysis dated November 19th, 2001, entitled, ""The September 11th Attack: A Preliminary Assessment,"" states, ""We do not know the process by which bin Laden and his lieutenants decided to hijack planes with the idea of flying them into buildings in the United States. But the idea of hijacking planes for suicide attacks had long been current in jihadist circles. For example, GIA terrorists from Algeria had planned to crash an Air France jet into the Eiffel Tower in December 1994. And Ramzi Yousef, a participant in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, planned to explode 12 U.S. jet airliners, jetliners, in midair over the Pacific in the mid 1990s. Likewise, the World Trade Center had long been a target of terrorist bombers."" Despite the intelligence available in recent years, our review to date has found no indication that prior to September 11th, analysts from the intelligence community were cataloguing information regarding the use of airplanes as weapons as a terrorist tactic, sending requirements to collectors to look for additional information on this threat, or considering the likelihood that Osama bin Laden, al Qaeda or any other terrorist group would attack the United States or U.S. interests in these ways -- in this way. Mr. Chairman, our purpose this morning was to report on the information that the intelligence community possessed prior to September 11th, 2001 about terrorist attacks of the kind America witnessed on that fateful day. In closing, let me just say that for all of us who have been conducting this review, the task has been and continues to be not only a daunting one but, in all respects, a sobering one. We are ever mindful that lost lives and shattered families were the catalyst for this inquiry. We know, as I have heard Ms. Pelosi say many times, that we are on sacred ground. We also have come to know, from our review of the intelligence reporting, the depth and the intensity of the enemy's hatred for this country and the relentless zeal with which it targeted American lives. We understand not only the importance but also the enormity of the task facing the intelligence community. As my statement this morning suggests, the community made mistakes prior to September 11th, and the problems that led to those mistakes need to be addressed and they need to be fixed. On the other hand, the vengeance and the inhumanity that we saw on that day were not mistakes for Osama bin Laden and for others like him. The responsibility for September 11th remains squarely on the shoulders of the terrorists who planned and participated in the attacks. Their fervor and their cruelty may be incomprehensible, but it is real. It persists, and it is directed at Americans. We are convinced that it is no longer a question of whether the intelligence community can do better. It must do better. America can afford no less. Mr. Chairman, that concludes my statement this morning. Thank you. SEN. GRAHAM: Ms. Hill, I would like to extend my congratulations to you and the staff for an excellent, sobering assessment of the events prior to September the 11th. I recognize this is the first of what will be a series of publicly-released statements of the results of our inquiry to date, and we look forward to your future reports. MS. HILL: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. SEN. GRAHAM: We will now proceed to questions and comments from members, starting with Senator DeWine. Let me just state who the next questioners will be: Mr. Boehlert, Senator Wyden, Mr. Bereuter, Mr. Bishop, Senator Levin, Senator Inhofe, Mr. Peterson, Mr. Cramer. SEN. MIKE DEWINE (R-OH): Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. Ms. Hill, thank you for your very good statement and your good work. MS. HILL: Thank you, Senator. SEN. DEWINE: Mr. Chairman, thank you for the opportunity to make some brief remarks at this very important public hearing. Let me also thank our witnesses who testified this morning. While none of us can really understand what we've been through, I have seen how tragic the events of September 11th have been for my own state director, a very good friend of mine, Barbara Skenk (sp). Barbara lost her husband, Doug Cherry (sp), to the terrorist attacks. Before talking about what I hope comes out of these hearings, let me express a concern. I've been concerned from the outset of this investigation that the timed deadlines under which this committee is operating would not be conducive to producing the product that we want. The artificial deadline, I believe, is making it extremely difficult to get the job done. It's simply a lack of time. It's a lack of resources. However, Mr. Chairman, there still are things that we can accomplish, even with the current constraints of this investigation. First, it is important to report -- and we've begun this today -- it's important to report to the American people what intelligence failures did occur, not so we can assess blame but so we can learn from the specific mistakes that were made. But there is more to it than that. Yes, we need to gather the facts and take time to examine what they mean with regard to what happened on September 11th. But we certainly cannot stop there. We also need to figure out what these facts tell us about the current structure of our overall intelligence community. What are the shortcomings? Where do we need reform? Now, I felt Mr. Push's testimony earlier was very excellent. I thought he talked about some of the big-picture issues that we're not going to resolve on this committee, but at least we can begin to look at and begin that national dialogue about these issues. So I thought his testimony was particularly telling. I think, for example, Mr. Chairman, in investigating these issues, we must take a serious look at the role of the director of Central Intelligence. I believe it's time to give the DCI the necessary authority and ability to truly direct our overall intelligence operations. Quite simply, we need to empower the DCI to do the job. I believe we also must seriously examine the long-term resource issues that confront us, not just now but over the long haul, over the next decade or two decades. Do we have the human resources available within the agencies themselves? Do we have the right technology and enough of it to get the job done in the new world that we live in? Do we have a long-term commitment to intelligence? I think we need to discuss that commitment and what we are looking at and make it very plain to the American people the sacrifices that are going to have to be made if that intelligence community is to do its job and what kind of resources they need. And finally, I believe that we need to re-examine the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act with the FISA statute and determine what changes are needed to make sure we are getting the intelligence resources to help prevent future attacks. FISA deserves and requires a great deal of attention and oversight from the joint committee, from the Senate and House Intelligence Committees, and frankly from the entire Congress. We must focus our congressional duty for oversight, as we simply have not had, in my opinion, effective oversight since FISA was instituted approximately a quarter of a century ago. Somehow we've got to figure out, Mr. Chairman, how to do that. Finally, this committee's job, I believe, is really to kick off, to launch, a serious national debate about what changes must be made in our intelligence community, because if we've learned anything from September 11th, it is that our security, our safety, the safety of our loved ones, is intrinsically linked to the quality of that intelligence. I thank the chair. SEN. GRAHAM: Thank you, Senator. Congressman Boehlert. REP. SHERWOOD BOEHLERT (R-NY): Mr. Chairman, let me ask a procedure. Are we just to have an opening statement or to go right to questions? SEN. GRAHAM: It is your choice. You have five minutes for either questions or discussion. REP. BOEHLERT: I thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Ms. Hill, let me thank you for an excellent presentation. Let me begin where you ended. You said, ""We are convinced that it is no longer a question of whether the intelligence community can do better. It must do better. America can afford no less."" I could not agree more with that statement. Your summation of our 10 closed hearings and the revelation of information in the public domain is somewhat difficult to deal with, because so much of what we've had, obviously, during those closed hearings has been highly classified, dealing with sensitive national- security information. But it appears to me that the alarm was sounded not once but several times, but too many gave it a deaf ear. I'm not ascribing any sinister motives. I'm just saying too many were not paying attention. There are a lot of reasons for that -- resource deficiencies, lack of adequate staff. Some of the revelations in your testimony are just absolutely mind-boggling. But let me ask something. Back in '98, when the director of Central Intelligence declared war on al Qaeda, sent a memorandum to his agency people. Was it a unilateral declaration of war? Was that memorandum shared with anyone but the in-house people at CIA? Did it go to the FBI? Did it go to all the other agencies in the intelligence community? MS. HILL: We have been following that question in the course of our interviews, and we've been basically -- we're dealing with a lot of the agencies in the intelligence community. We're trying to find out how much the entire community was aware of that declaration of war. And what we're finding is some people were, I think, close; certainly senior levels in the CIA were, and probably in the CIA. But as I mentioned, if you go out to the field offices of the FBI, they were not aware of it. Other people in the federal government were not aware of it. The Defense Department people -- we've interviewed some people there who were not aware of it who might have been interfacing with the community. So I would say it appears to be it was the DCI's decision. It was circulated to some people, but certainly not broadly within the community. And what I find disturbing about it is that it was at senior levels, but sometimes the operative level, the level in the field is where it actually is critical that they know what the priorities should be and have to be, particularly when it's something like combating something like al Qaeda. The field offices of the FBI, in terms of domestic activity, are crucial, because they are the ones who are going to be in the front lines in the United States dealing with those kinds of groups. And, at least in that respect, what we're finding is that many of them were not aware of that declaration of war, and some of them really were not focused very much at all on al Qaeda and bin Laden. REP. BOEHLERT: Well, I find that incomprehensible, quite frankly, because a key operative in our intelligence community, a leader, issued something as important as a declaration of war against an organization that has openly declared its determined effort, the fatwah, the religious decree, to destroy America and Americans. And that information is not shared at the highest level down to the lowest level, which brings me forward to the Phoenix memo and the Minneapolis case involving Mr. Moussaoui. And I've checked with counsel to see if it's all right to reveal some of this stuff, because the problem is I have difficulty, and I've had it for all the years I've served on the committee, in recalling where I learned the information I have. Was it from a highly secure, highly sensitive briefing, or did I read it in the front page of the newspaper? And so my practice has been to just not talk to the media at all about this very important assignment. Then we go forward to the Phoenix memo, which was sent up to headquarters, at a time we had a declaration of war in the intelligence community, and the memo was marked ""routine."" MS. HILL: Well, and it was not only at the time of the declaration of war; it was in the summer of 2001. It was at a time when the threat level was very high also. REP. BOEHLERT: And so the memo was marked ""routine,"" and it was given the most routine handling and never got above mid-level. And then we go out to Minneapolis and the Moussaoui case, and that was treated in a somewhat cavalier, very routine manner. I fail to see how, with all the alarms that were sounded -- well, we know there was not the proper coordination. There was not the proper information-sharing. You have indicated some corrective action has been taken -- oh, my God, we'd only hope so -- since September 11th. But I would suggest a lot of corrective action should have been taken well before September 11th. Let me ask you this. With our first two witnesses, Ms. Breitweiser and Mr. Push -- and their testimony was very poignant -- SEN. GRAHAM: Your time has expired. REP. BOEHLERT: That's a fast five minutes. Just let me finish the one question; I'm in the middle of it. SEN. GRAHAM: We'll be compassionate. REP. BOEHLERT: Did you spend an extended amount of time with both of these witnesses? Because they both have statements that are forever seared in our souls. Some deal with opinion. Others deal with alleged facts. And so did you spend a good amount of time with them? And have you checked up on the alleged facts that they presented? And I'm not questioning those facts; I just want to make sure we're dealing with the same information. MS. HILL: I have met with Ms. Breitweiser several times, since I joined this effort with the committee, with her and her group. And Mr. Push, I believe I've met with him once. I have not checked up on all the specifics in their statement because I didn't see their statements till -- we got those statements yesterday. But I've had a lot of discussions with them. And some of the things, you know, that they mentioned, I'm aware of. Some of them I'd want to look into in more detail, obviously. REP. BOEHLERT: Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your indulgence. SEN. GRAHAM: Thank you. Senator Wyden. SEN. RON WYDEN (R-OR): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ms. Hill, as you know, there were years of history indicating that airplanes would be used as a tool of terrorism. And yet you state on page 30 -- and I'll quote here -- ""Our review to date has found no indications that prior to September 11th analysts in the intelligence community were cataloguing information regarding the use of airplanes as weapons as a terrorist tactic, sending requirements to collectors to look for additional information on this threat, or considering the likelihood that bin Laden, al Qaeda or other terrorist groups would attack the United States or U.S. interests in this way."" That is a remarkable statement, given the history going back I believe to 1994 at least. And my question to begin with is when you ask the intelligence community why this was the case, why they didn't catalogue this information regarding the use of planes as weapons or consider the likelihood that they would be used as terrorist tools, what was the response of the intelligence community when you asked them why? MS. HILL: Well, I think a couple things. They would probably say to that question, and we've spoken to many people over there and gotten opinions and reactions on this, you have to understand the reason we have been able to catalogue all these instances is because one of the things we did was ask the community to go back and find anything that related to aircraft as weapons. So we went back and consolidated and went through their databases to pull it all out so you could see it all together. And I don't believe that had been done before we focused on it, given September 11th. So, one, it's not been all pulled together for them to see it other than piecemeal over time. Secondly, I think what they will tell you on almost many of these things in the terrorism field is that they were overwhelmed. The people who were looking at al-Qaeda and bin Laden will complain to you about resources, about the amount of information that was coming in. They were overwhelmed by almost a flood of information. Because as you can see from our statement there's a lot of reporting in there just on these topics. And, of course that reporting is but a small amount of the overall amount of reporting that the community deals with. So I think the reason they would give you that they had not done that was that it was spread out over time, they were overwhelmed by resources and other priorities and they were overwhelmed by the amount of information they were getting and dealing with the responses to other areas. SEN. WYDEN: What is so hard to swallow, however, is how anything could be a higher priority than this. And for you to state that the intelligence community was not considering the likelihood that bin Laden, al-Qaeda would attack the United States in this way is, of course exactly the kind of thing we've got to address in this inquiry. In your testimony and also from the victims' families we have heard about the failure to place Khalid al-Midhar and Nawaf Alhazmi -- and by the way Mr. Alhazmi is listed in the phone book in San Diego, I gather -- MS. HILL: I'm aware of that. SEN. WYDEN: -- on a watch list that would have prevented their entry into the United States. I offered an amendment on the intelligence bill this year to create a terrorist tracking system that would help ensure that this information would finally actually get shared to everybody in the intelligence area, everybody in the law enforcement area and would actually get to local law enforcement officials. In your view, to make this kind of system effective, what sort of policies need to be included so that finally we can respond to what Mr. Push has asked for, and that is to have a system that on an ongoing basis makes this a top priority, tracking the most dangerous individuals who threaten this country? MS. HILL: Well, I think part of it is you have to get people's attention. I mean, you have to get people focused on the need to do that, people in the system, in the agencies and in the groups that are working on those issues. I mean, in this case, and we're going to go into that particular case in much more detail when we present our testimony or our statement on the hijackers that would relate to the case you're talking about, so we will go into it in a lot more detail and tell you what we've heard from people who were handling that information at the time and why it slipped by them. But I think part of what you will hear again was you may hear things, everything from they had too many things to do, it wasn't considered that significant, they were overwhelmed and it was simply a mistake, they made a mistake. SEN. WYDEN: Mr. Chairman, my time has expired. I would only want to add one last point with respect to where I think we are in terms of our inquiry. As we all know, there are many both on this committee and off who think that essentially this committee ought to punt to an independent effort. I'm of the view that the bar is very, very high now in terms of establishing the credibility of this effort and to show that we're capable of attacking these fundamental problems. This is not something that's going to be solved by just moving the boxes around on the organizational charts and people going up with pointers and saying the problem is solved. So I think Ms. Hill has helped us with the families to get off to a good start and I look forward to working with my colleagues. SEN. GRAHAM: Thank you very much, Senator. Mr. Bishop. REP. BISHOP: Thank you. This is indeed an historic occasion when the two intelligence committees are working together on a matter of great importance like this comes to pass. And I'm sure, however, that given the nature and the circumstances, which require our attention, the destructive attacks on our country September 11th, it's a task, which all of us wish that we didn't have to face. But we're most appreciative today for the well-prepared, thoughtful and helpful testimony presented by Ms. Breitweiser and Mr. Push. We have a responsibility to thoroughly and professionally gather, assess and present the facts about September 11th as they relate to the performance of the intelligence agencies. And as we enter these public hearings there remains a general sense of disappointment and disbelief within the American people that those agencies, particularly the CIA and the FBI, were not better positioned to detect the conspiracy and to prevent the attacks. We must try to address the many questions, which have arisen about why better intelligence was not collected, why better use was not made of the information, which was available, and now publicly examining the performance of the community and the decisions that were made in the Executive Branch and perhaps in Congress about the establishment of priorities within the intelligence community. We will be conducting the type of oversight, which these committees are at present uniquely situated to provide. It is my continued hope that these hearings and our final report will result in a marked improvement in our understanding of the events that led up to 9/11 and most importantly in our ability to protect the American people from terrorist attacks such as these. I look forward to working with the joint leadership and all of our scheduled witnesses, and I want to thank Ms. Hill and her staff for the tremendous work that they have done under very, very difficult circumstances with some muzzling and bridling and limitations and with great time constraints. It has, I think, been a valiant effort and we will certainly as a committee work with you to try to secure the cooperation that you need from the Executive Branch and the agencies in getting access and being able to explain to the American people and have this committee explain to the American people in the kind of detail, which does not compromise forces and methods, plans and intentions or active or ongoing prosecutions so that they can understand as well as we hope to understand what happened, why it happened and what we can do to make sure it does not happen again. With that, I have no questions, but I did want to share those comments and thank again the witnesses for taking the time and the effort, which must have been extremely difficult, given the exigencies of your lives over the past year to have come forward and done the magnificent job that you did today. SEN. GRAHAM: Thank you, Mr. Bishop. Our next questioner or discussant will be Senator Levin. After Senator Levin, Mr. Boswell, Mr. Castle, Mr. Roemer, Ms. Harman, Mr. Burr, Senator Bayh and Senator Rockefeller. Senator Levin. SEN. LEVIN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and first let me thank you, Ms. Hill and your staff for getting us to the point where we are finally analyzing and presenting to the American people the significant intelligence failures, which occurred prior to September 11th. At this stage of the inquiry much is already evident. First, the intelligence community said that it was at war with Osama bin Laden and had said so for three years prior to the attack of September 11th. Second, despite National Security Advisor Condaleeza Rice's assertions to the contrary, the use of a plane as a terrorist weapon, capable of causing mass casualties, was neither ingenuous nor novel but rather a method of attack that the intelligence community knew that the terrorists were considering as early as the early to mid 90s. Third, there is much troubling evidence that information crucial to preventing attacks by al-Qaeda terrorists was not shared or acted upon by intelligence officials prior to September 11th. Those intelligence failures will haunt loved ones and their families and should also haunt us and motivate us to very strong and necessary reforms. Here are just a few examples that I'm summarizing from your report: In January of 2000 the U.S. intelligence community was alerted to a meeting of al-Qaeda members in Malaysia, including two of the eventual hijackers of America Airlines Flight 77. The handoff of that information from the CIA to the FBI was bungled. The individuals were not tracked and inexplicably were not promptly placed on a watch list. Ten days later the two accomplices entered the United States on a flight to Los Angeles. The location of the individuals after they were finally placed on the watch list was also mishandled. Second, a July 10, 2001 memorandum from an FBI field agent in Phoenix to the Osama bin Laden unit and the radical fundamentalist unit at FBI headquarters, requesting that an investigation be opened into foreign terrorist training at flight schools in the U.S. was never acted upon, nor was the Phoenix field investigation shared with the CIA as specifically suggested by the FBI agent. And this is not in your memo, but this is what we learned, that nearly a year after the Phoenix memo the FBI director was unable to explain to our committee who saw that request from the Phoenix FBI agent, what was done with the request and who, if anyone, had been held accountable for letting that important information fall between some crack. Third, the August 16th, 2001 arrest of Zacarias Moussaoui and the suspicions of the FBI agents in Minneapolis that he might be planning to undertake a terrorist attack using a plane, and the urgent request that a warrant to search his computer and other belongings were not acted upon by FBI headquarters And I want to emphasize a point here. These were not some reports from unreliable sources. These were not unconfirmed statements. These were FBI agents that were asking for action. Their requests were ignored. Now, I believe it is critically important for the administration to release the Phoenix memorandum, documents relating to the Minneapolis FBI office request and other documents that will allow the American people to judge for themselves the significance of these missed signals and the failures to share information between and within the intelligence and law enforcement communities. The committee, I understand, has asked for declassification of those documents. That request is under consideration, I understand, by the administration in preparation for next week's hearings. And I -- we've had discussion about this already this morning, but I do hope that the leadership of these committees, our committees, will let the administration know that our committees will seek congressional authorization, by legislation if necessary, to declassify appropriate information if the executive branch refuses. We have chairmen and vice chairmen of our committees who have agreed on some matters. It seems to me that is enough for us as committees to automatically authorize them to seek legislation should the executive branch refuse. And that would go to future refusals, not just to previous ones. The American people understand that perfection is unattainable, but they also believe, as I do, that when errors are made, accountability -- accountability is essential if lessons are to be learned for the sake of the future security of our nation. Now, is my time up? SEN. GRAHAM: Thank you, Senator, for those very thoughtful -- (applause) -- and obviously well-received suggestions of actions by the committee. We will take those under advisement. Mr. Boswell. REP. LEONARD BOSWELL (D-IA): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think the word that's hit me hardest today has been the word ""sobering."" And as I heard the testimony of Kristen and Stephen, it caused me to have a little flashback in my earlier life when I had to spend a lonely night, as some of the rest of you have done, to write to the loved ones where their loved one was lost in the battlefield that day. I've sensed your pain. I love you, respect you, and want you to have relief. And I see the relief for you is to see that these lessons learned are learned and followed and not have to be learned again. I used to work for Admiral Flecky (sp), the -- probably the most decorated living American -- you put that in your lessons learned file and don't have to learn it again, and that's what I hope we accomplish here. I feel like that maybe my colleague from the Senate that said that maybe we don't need this extra (blue ribbon ?) panel after listening to Kristen and Stephen. I think he made a pretty good case, maybe we do need it. And I wonder about the time, and the resource, and availability to us to finish this job. Well, I trust that in the days lying ahead of you, Mr. Chairman, you're going to be dealing with this side of the operation and I know you'll give it serious consideration. A couple of questions, Ms. Hill, that I might ask, and I'll just ask them all, and then I can refresh if you need them, but I assume if -- do you intend to have further statements of fact as we go forward from here today? MS. HILL: Not today, but we do in the future hearings, right. REP. BOSWELL: I mean in the future -- all right. Would you want to elaborate a little bit on what -- or could you -- what agencies had responsibility to respond to the warnings? We've heard so much about the warnings for two, three years. Would you have any comment from your research and your study that -- who should have been responding? Military? Who? MS. HILL: Well, it would depend on what -- you mean a warning from the intelligence community or the reports? I mean -- REP. BOSWELL: Or a combination -- did we fail as part of our lesson learned, if we can, an area of -- maybe there should have been some responses going out to somebody else? MS. HILL: Well, some of the -- I mean, some of this information was disseminated further, some was not disseminated. Some, for instance, we talked about some went to the FAA in certain cases, and then they in turn would put out a warning. For instance, I talked about the one of terrorist attack to commercial, private industry. REP. BOSWELL: Okay. MS. HILL: So, it depends on the nature of what the threat was and who they would warn. But -- REP. BOSWELL: I think in your further analysis that may be what I'm asking, is that you share with us as you look at it and have more time, if there are some things that we could put in this -- MS. HILL: We are -- I can say that we are pursuing the whole issue of -- I mean, there's questions, warnings and dissemination of information, is not just sharing information, as Senator Levin was talking about, within the intelligence community, between the FBI and CIA for example, but also sharing threat information beyond the intelligence community to the agencies within government, outside the community, and also to the private sector, which gets into the warning and how far this information went. And that is an area we're looking at, and we haven't yet, you know, come back with a report on it, but we are looking at that. And -- and, you know, that's a valid point, because the intelligence -- not only is the job to get the good intelligence and to analyze it, but then to disseminate it to people who can use it in a timely manner. So -- REP. BOSWELL: Okay, thank you. And I just -- I've got a little bit of time left -- do you have any comments about the, you know, all the emphasis on bin Laden and his activities and his lack of, prior to September 11th, that is, lack of ability to -- to bring damage to us -- did that lure people into complacency, even at the senior levels? MS. HILL: I think part of it is, as I alluded to earlier, is that the community, you know, does get so much information, and as I said in this statement, there were a lot of these threats coming in, but they -- a lot of them, they couldn't really corroborate. They didn't know if some of them were true or not true. So, I think, you know, it may be human nature if you keep hearing this stuff all the time and nothing happens and you never really know if it's accurate, you tend to start disregarding. And the -- the problem is that buried in the middle of all that where some may be accurate, some may be not, there may be something that really is important that needs to be looked at. So, it may be that when the threat level was very high and all the chatter was coming through, it was hard to distinguish what was really legitimate and something they needed to be concerned about. REP. BOSWELL: Thank you very much. My time is up. I appreciate the hard work that you've presented to us, the straightforwardness, and I'm looking forward to what you further have to say as we go on from here. MS. HILL: Thank you. SEN. GRAHAM: Thank you, Mr. Boswell. Mr. Castle. REP. MICHAEL CASTLE (R-DE): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would also like to thank Ms. Breitweiser and Mr. Push for their testimony on their own behalf and on behalf of the others who have endured this. You're brave to be here, but you also had a lot to say, and from a perspective that's different than we've heard so far. And I also thank Ms. Hill for making sure that we started off with this testimony, I think it's vitally important now that we hear this. And some of my -- these are sort of statements-slash-questions, let me go through a few of them, and if we have time, perhaps you could respond to some of them, Ms. Hill, based in large part on matters that both Kristen and Stephen reference. But what has concerned me for some time, and Mr. (Boehlert ?) referenced it too, and that is the whole business of -- of public verses private, or classified information verses non-classified information. I for one have felt for some time, having served on this committee for a while now, that we over-classify terribly in the world of intelligence. You read about it the next day in the New York Times, it's about 90 percent of what you had heard about the day before. And I just have serious questions about that. But the point was made in some of their testimony about the failure to warn the public -- and I would imagine the public really didn't know much about bin Laden. Based on what you said, I'm not even sure the intelligence community knew what it should have known about bin Laden when September 11th came in 2001. We saw what the president has been able to do with Saddam Hussein, who is probably on the forefront of the minds of almost every American today. We know what can be done if there is a greater public awareness of what is going on. And a lot that's happened since September 11th of last year has caused us all to be much more aware of possible terrorist activities or whatever. I would hope as our committee looks at all this we'd look at the public aspect of it. The American public is very intelligent and very cognizant of what's going on in the world, and if they're given a chance to know what the potential problems are, my sense is that perhaps we can prevent some of the problems that we've had so far, and we shouldn't be so closed as far as intelligence is concerned. Now, I understand there are circumstances in which that cannot happen. I well understand that and I'm not trying to go too far in saying that, but I really think we need to visit that question in terms of speeches being given by people in the intelligence community perhaps could be more open in terms of information that could be released, that kind of thing. And I'm very interested in pursuing that at some point. Something that Mr. Push said I had heard earlier when I had visited the homeland security, and that is that the officials here in Washington were struck by how much the local law enforcement officers know about what's happening in their communities, about individuals in their communities, perhaps troubled individuals in their communities, various things that we probably would never know in Washington, D.C. There are a whole lot of them, you know, well over half-a-million state and local law enforcement officers who have a tremendous world of knowledge. And I think that homeland security is looking at trying to develop and to cultivate that knowledge, and to make it part of a central -- not a central bank necessarily, but the ability to have that information go up and be digested and used in dealing with terrorists and other activities in this country. I think that's vitally important. We don't hear much about that. We hear about the CIA and the FBI and NSA and various major federal agencies. When you're dealing overseas, that's probably what it's all about. But when you're dealing in America, and also even when you are dealing overseas, you are dealing with some sort of a cell or a pod or somebody who is here locally. It is very helpful to have that information. And I hope as we go about our business of this particular committee and what we are doing that we incorporate that into it as well. So that also concerns me. And there's another area that is much broader too than anything we have talked about, and that's the area of prevention overall. I am vitally concerned about the hatred that exist in the Middle East apparently, at least in certain pockets of the Middle East, for America and perhaps for Israel and other portions of the world. And I don't know how to go about this. I am not suggesting that we should be starting to formulate policy with respect to diplomacy and education, but it seems to me it is something we should be paying attention to. If we could get to the root causes of this, of why that is there, if we could start to build the relationships that might change -- this might take 10, 15 or 25 years -- but I don't think we should ignore it. And perhaps it's a little bit beyond what we are doing on this committee. But the bottom line is I think it's a very important function of what we are doing as American citizens to try to prevent terrorist activities as far as the future is concerned. And I do have a specific question -- I'd like you to comment on any of those things -- and then a specific question and I think about 10 seconds here I think -- and that is just how far along are we in terms of all of your work. Are we going to be able to get our work done by the completion of this Congress? MS. HILL: I am optimistic that we will be able to get through what we have in our minds sat down and figured would be our schedule in terms of treating various topics that we think need to be treated. Where no one can ever be sure is that things are still coming up as we investigate. You know, once you start looking at an agency, and you are going through files, what tends to happen is the more you get into it the more you start finding more things. And as we find things, we want to follow those where the facts lead and make sure we understand what did or did not happen. And that takes time. So there are some things like that that we are now working on that are going to take us more time, because we haven't planned for that. But I am cautiously optimistic we can make what I think would be a significant contribution on this whole front in terms of really understanding what did and didn't happen here before the 11th, and why we didn't know more in terms of what were the systemic problems that were preventing people from knowing more. So I can't -- I would be foolish to sit here and tell you we are going to look at every single document on terrorism that the United States government had for the last 20 years, because we haven't tried to do that. We've tried to narrow it to where we get to the relevant material that pertains to September 11th. And that I think we have a good shot at doing. REP. CASTLE: Thank you, Ms. Hill. I'll take my other statements, and perhaps we can discuss them further at some point. I yield back, Mr. Chairman. SEN. GRAHAM: Thank you, Mr. Castle. Senator Rockefeller. SEN. ROCKEFELLER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Ms. Hill, very much for your distinguished work. In the interest of time, Mr. Chairman, I would like to make just three points. First, the fundamental question is what did the intelligence community know and then what did they do with what they knew? The work of the committee has not to this point unearthed any single piece of information, or smoking gun, if you will, that would have in and of itself prevented the attack. But we have found far too many breakdowns in the intelligence gathering and processing method. My own conclusion is that given the events and signals of the preceding decade, the intelligence community could have, and in my judgment should have, anticipated an attack on U.S. soil on the scale of 9/11. We had witnessed attacks on Americans overseas, as you laid out -- U.S.S. Cole, Kenya, Tanzania, Khobar, 1993 attack on the World Trade Center. We knew beyond any doubt that al Qaeda wanted to strike the United States. We were just sort of struck in our classic American innocence that anything that is going to happen is going to happen overseas. But there was information, and plenty of it, disseminated or not disseminated, that something was going to happen here. Yet the intelligence community for a whole host of reasons did not launch the all-out effort that is its responsibility, that might have detected and potentially prevented 9/11. Second, the FBI is an outstanding law enforcement agency, but I have serious questions about whether it is the right place to do intelligence work necessary in our country. Law enforcement is not necessarily compatible with intelligence gathering; in fact, it is not. It is not the same skills, not the same mission. Going forward we must not undermine the FBI's ability to carry out its fundamental responsibilities, because they are very important, and they do it very well. And we must not give short shrift to new intelligence demands. So we have to ask ourselves, Can the problem be addressed by reforming the FBI? I don't think so. Or is this a case where we need to find a wholly different solution? This is a tough question, obviously, which I hope this committee will be tackling in the coming months, and it leads me to my final point. Are we ready -- as a committee, as a Congress, as a government, as a people -- not only to pose the tough questions -- it's easy to do -- but also to find and to implement the tough solutions? It is clear to all of us that we must make serious changes in how we gather, process and react to intelligence in this country. Our existing agencies came into being in the Cold War -- that's fine. That structure no longer matches the threat that we face. Lines of authority are, in my judgment, blurred intentionally for the sake of turf, for the sake of all kinds of things which in some cases have justification and in many cases do not. The whole process leading up to today has been an interesting example of how difficult it is to get, you know at a very common purpose, to get people to agree on some relatively simple things. So lines of authority are blurred, information gets lost, and the mission is unfocused. The intelligence mission is unfocused. It might best be described as trying to do everything, and in the process doing little well. Far-reaching change isn't just a goal, it's a necessity. Unfortunately, it's a very controversial and very uncomfortable necessity. It's something they don't want to do here in Congress, they don't want to do at the White House, they don't want to do at the Defense Department, they don't want to do in the non-defense intelligence aspect of what we carry on in this country. But are we going to find the political will to create an intelligence system that works? Or are we going to say that this is going to be politically impractical or probably not doable, and therefore cut our goal by 50 percent, and then get leveraged down from there? So are we as a committee in which we have our own differences and our own conflicts -- as a Congress, where the same exists, and as a government where the same exists, and in the intelligence community where the same exists -- do we have the political will and the strength and the determination to do the job right? Nothing else counts. Thank you. SEN. GRAHAM: Thank you, senator. Mr. Roemer. REP. ROEMER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank Ms. Hill for an excellent presentation and outline this afternoon to help us understand this issue a bit more after several months of this investigation. I want to compliment your top-notch staff for their sacrifices and their hours of service to the country. And, Mr. Chairman, you and Mr. Goss on my side -- I want to compliment both of you for bringing together in a bipartisan way this committee to launch an unprecedented bicameral investigation into the worst terrorist attack in our nation's history. And it is with pride and confidence that I know we will produce a good product on this committee. In listening to the very moving testimony from Kristen and Steve this morning, I am even more convinced, I am even more compelled to work hard. I am even more persuaded that an independent blue-ribbon commission is the right way to go. It's the right way to go, because if this committee with its jurisdiction and its might and insight, and experience and dedication to intelligence, does its job, and by the very nature of an investigative inquiry staff doing their job over an eight-month period, unearthing facts, uncovering data, asking tough questions, they will produce even more questions for us to try to answer over the next year. So I think there is a compelling case by the very effectiveness of this committee to do its job near perfectly, and assume its jurisdiction as a body of Congress to take on this tough task, we make the case in a very convincing way for follow-up, and a thread attached to this for an independent blue ribbon commission to continue to look at these very, very tough questions, as to how to reorganize an intelligence community that made mistakes, that committed failures, that saw warnings, and reorganize it in a time when we are threatened by a brand-new source that wants to kill Americans in massive numbers very quickly. And they can do it in this kind of world environment. I think the case is made compellingly for an independent blue ribbon commission. And I think that complements us. And I think it adds into the history of this committee, the Intelligence Committee, which has had independent commission, as Aspin-Brown, Hart-Rudman, the NRO, Rumsfeld on ICBMs, and even in the Senate bill a brand-new commission to study something else. Ms. Hill, I do have a question or two that I wanted to ask about the classification of data. On page 16 there is a reference to information provided to senior U.S. government officials in September of 1998, and on page 28 mentioning senior government officials in July of 2001. Now, without getting into breaking our classification -- and we don't want to do that -- one would be a Democratic administration, one would be a Republican administration. Is there the possibility that those references might be, could be, to a White House? MS. HILL: Well, you know, obviously given the classification -- REP. ROEMER: I'm just asking in the realm of possibilities. MS. HILL: Well, I guess are you asking the term ""senior government officials"" couldn't -- I mean, I guess the term ""senior government officials"" would be anyone at a senior level in the entire U.S. government. So -- but I cannot -- as I understand the rules on this, we are not allowed -- REP. ROEMER: But your case, Ms. Hill, is that it is important for the American people to know when we get intelligence that it is not only intelligence agencies that act upon it, it's the administration, as to what they do with it, with the military, with other branches of government, the FAA -- MS. HILL: Right. REP. ROEMER: The Border Patrol and so forth and so on. MS. HILL: That's absolutely right, because to make intelligence really the way it should be, important and valuable, it has to be not only collected, analyzed, but it has to be disseminated to the people who can use it in a timely manner. That's the whole point of having intelligence. So -- REP. ROEMER: Part of our bipartisan efforts would be to get in a bipartisan way this access to declassifying that kind of reference. Is that your argument? MS. HILL: Well, I mean, our argument on this issue about the White House is that if you have declassified the information itself, it seems to us we don't see the national security interests in declassifying where it goes from there. If you declassify it it goes to some people, and you should be able to declassify, it goes to everybody, or whoever it went to to explain the -- REP. ROEMER: I would hope our committee would have a long, very serious discussion about what to do on the classification issue. Finally, Ms. Hill, if I could ask one final question, you mentioned the CTC and the number of analysts that they had, and I think mentioned a number of three to five. MS. HILL: Right. REP. ROEMER: Yet as we've looked at the CTC budget over the 1990s and a question of resources, without mentioning a specific number, which is classified, the trend which we can talk about -- right? MS. HILL: Right. REP. ROEMER: -- is quadrupling in the CTC budget. So why isn't more money put into analysts in that budget which is quadrupling? MS. HILL: I think it's a priority question. I mean, it's -- you know, as the -- and what we found and what we are saying is that the resources -- that we are getting more resources for counterterrorism prior to September 11th and after the DCI declared war on bin Laden it was going up. But there was no massive shift. It was a gradual thing. And in terms of the analysis, there was not a significant amount of resources dedicated to it. So I assume it is like every other resource allocation: it is depending on where your priorities are. And obviously there was not a big priority on the analysis. REP. ROEMER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. SEN. GRAHAM: Thank you, Mr. Roemer. Mr. LaHood. REP. LAHOOD: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ms. Hill, thank you for your service to our committee -- and to your staff too -- I know they've worked long hours. MS. HILL: That's very true, and they've done an excellent job. They really have. I agree with that. And to Kristen and Steve, thank you for -- if you are still here -- for being here -- and your testimony and the people that you represent. Obviously our hearts go out to all of you. Ms. Hill, if you take all the information that's in your report today and you analyze all that information, and then you look at the notion that there was a lot of information prior to 9/11, there were a lot of people in separate ways who saw it, and if you took that information and it was analyzed correctly, and the people responsible, whether it would be the president, the vice president, the national security advisor, the CIA director or FBI director -- if they had had all the information that you collected and documented in your report, could 9/11 have been prevented? If they had seen the Phoenix memo, if they had seen the memo from Minnesota. If they had seen -- really had all of these transits, these documents that had come over the transit for any number of days? I mean, there has to be some idea about -- because the criticism is that a lot of information came, but it wasn't shared; a lot of information was available, but wasn't shared, and the right people didn't know it. Well, if you take all that information, and if it had been shared with the highest elected people in our government and the highest appointed people in our government who have responsibility for counteracting these activities, could 9/11 have been prevented? MS. HILL: My own view is that I don't think anyone will ever be able to say -- no one will ever really know whether 9/11 could have been prevented, because what we are talking about here is we not only would have to know what everyone would have done with the information they had in the intelligence community in terms of law enforcement and intelligence, you would also have to know how bin Laden and the hijackers would have reacted. We don't know that. I mean, it's all -- we are hypothesizing. And there has been so much emphasis on was there a smoking gun, was there a -- when, where, how -- that sort of thing. We didn't find -- we haven't found that. What we have found is a lot of information, a lot of things that weren't put together. And to me maybe the biggest issue is, and we say it somewhat in the statement -- not only that they weren't put together, but they weren't recognizing the importance, given everything else they should have known for instance in the summer of 2001 -- that's the summer that you had Midhar, Alhazmi, you had Phoenix, you had Moussaoui, you had a high threat level. Well, you would think with all of that, when you got Phoenix or you got Moussaoui, it would have been even more -- you would have been more aggressive with it, and that didn't happen. So there's a lot of unknowns. There's questions whether people would have -- if you had caught hijacker would they have replaced him with someone else? There's questions about could you, if you had gotten onto one of these cases, could you have surveiled and perhaps found what was going on? All of those are hypotheticals, and we are never going to know. But I think what we do clearly know is that the community could have done a lot better on the intelligence side and the law enforcement side. REP. LAHOOD: But your answer is that the community could have done a lot better. But knowing what we know about information that was there -- and the dots were never connected in a lot of these different areas -- you are not saying though that the community could have prevented this. They could have done a lot better, but they couldn't have prevented -- MS. HILL: I'm saying they could have -- REP. LAHOOD: But they couldn't have prevented it? MS. HILL: No, I didn't say that. I never said they couldn't have. REP. LAHOOD: What I want to know -- I want you to be able to tell us pretty definitively here for these people that are here, that if all the dots were connected, and all the information was shared, and all the right people would have known it, could we have prevented 9/11? MS. HILL: I would say -- REP. LAHOOD: That's the criticism all over this town and all over the country and all over the world -- that we, you know, we collected a lot of information but it wasn't connected, that people didn't connect the dots, they didn't share the information. And my question is, and I think it's a question on the minds of the American people, if it had been done correctly, could it have been prevented. And people that are promoting a blue ribbon committee, which I am not, are saying that that's the way we get to the bottom line. But I want to know from you, who have been working at this now for several month, could it have been prevented? MS. HILL: I, I can't say guaranteed that it could have been prevented. There could have been some things done that there's possible that they might have been able to uncover some of this plot if they had had the information on individuals, and they had followed them and they had surveiled them. And the individuals had talked about something and they might have picked it up. I mean, all of those are ifs. It's one if after another. You're never going to know that, but if you don't get beyond the point that they could have done better, you know, that is what they have to do the next time. Because if they don't, you're not going to have a shot at preventing this the next time. That's where the issue is. Not so much preventing what's already happened. It's preventing what may happen in the future that we have to focus on. That's my own view. And I think to prevent what may happen in the future, there's a lot of things that have to be done to get us there. SEN. GRAHAM: Thank you, Mr. LaHood. Let me say, tomorrow we're going to have two panels with five persons in total, all of whom have had extensive experience at the highest level of actually making decisions based on intelligence. And I would suggest the question you just asked of Ms. Hill would be a very appropriate question to ask of those panelists to get their assessment of whether there was enough information from the experience and perspective that they had and can provide as to whether there was enough to have avoided September the 11th. Mr. Hoekstra. REP. PETER HOEKSTRA (R-MI): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I'd like to thank the chairmen for how they started off these public hearings, I believe, with Steve and Kristen today. It's a very appropriate way to begin the process by remembering those whose families paid the ultimate sacrifice on September 11 and recognizing the sense of urgency and the importance with which this committee has to go through and conduct its work. And, Ms. Hill, thank you for your work -- MS. HILL: Thank you. REP. HOEKSTRA: -- having gone through some other investigations on other committees, recognizing the importance of how you approach this work and the intensity and the professionalism and having to put up with members of Congress. So thank you for being willing to go through that process. As you've gone through and done the analysis, have you also taken a look at other attempted terrorist activities during this time frame which may have been prevented because of knowledge that we had beforehand and things that might not be part of the public record? Have you uncovered anything like that? MS. HILL: You mean other actions by other groups or other -- REP. HOEKSTRA: By al Qaeda or other groups that -- where they had been planning on attacking the United States and, for one reason or another, those attacks were thwarted? MS. HILL: We have heard some of that. I mean, we have not focused on that because we were focusing on the information on aircrafts as weapons and September 11th. But certainly, in talking to people, there were successes by the intelligence community against al Qaeda and other terrorist groups. There were also, you know, failures. REP. HOEKSTRA: Other failures. MS. HILL: So, I mean, it was -- and I think -- I didn't read that part, but in our statement we talk about the fact that they did -- that it was a very difficult target for the intelligence community. Al Qaeda had a lot of operational security. They were hard to penetrate. They were hard to get them to talk about things that would help you. It was difficult. There were resource problems. But despite all that, the community did amass a lot of information on them and they were engaged in operations against al Qaeda and there were some successes, but there were also some failures. REP. HOEKSTRA: As you go through this process, will you also overlay policy decisions that were made, either in Congress or at the executive level? Specifically, I think, this morning Steve talked about -- and I'm not sure exactly what the words were -- but the inability to penetrate organizations like al Qaeda with human intelligence and recognizing that during parts of the '90s, you know, there were decisions that were made that changed the way that the CIA and other organizations could actually recruit human intelligence. MS. HILL: I think that area -- I mean, those are all valid policy questions, and it's relevant to how you, you know, how you combat terrorism in groups like this, obviously, because penetrating a group like this is tremendously important. It's a valuable source of intelligence. But I think those are issues that we will probably address. As I understand the chairman, one of the things we want to do as we get further away from the facts -- we're trying to get the factual review out first. That is a systemic problem -- and then look at possible ways to reform the community and changes and policy issues and those sorts of things. So I would guess that those issues would be addressed once we get into where do we go from here in terms of reform. REP. HOEKSTRA: Because it's very, very clear that the intelligence community and the various agencies don't operate in a vacuum. There are policies and decisions that are made over a period of time that will have an impact on the culture within the various agencies as to their ability to recruit or how they will use or who they will access for human intelligence. There's also decisions that are made by Congress in terms of the funding levels and direction and those types of things. And, you know, as the report moves forward, we will get a fuller context of where the breakdowns will be, some of which may have occurred within the intelligence agencies, some of which may have occurred in other parts of the executive branch, or some of which may have occurred in Congress because of decisions that have been made over here, so that we get that full picture of what went on. MS. HILL: Right. REP. HOEKSTRA: That will all be -- those are all areas that you plan on looking at? MS. HILL: I mean, the game plan, so to speak, is to look at the factual review, get through that, then look at the systemic issues and then decide how those systemic issues can be addressed through reform. And what you're talking about, I think, would be in the systemic-issue problems, restrictions on our ability to penetrate human sources, hum- int, and then where we go from here in terms of reform. REP. HOEKSTRA: Good. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, I yield back my time. SEN. GRAHAM: Thank you very much. Senator Shelby. SEN. SHELBY: Thank you. Ms. Hill, I've missed some of this because, like everybody, we have to do other things during the meeting. Would it be fair to say at this point in the inquiry, the investigation, that we're a long way from finishing our inquiry, are we not? MS. HILL: I like to look at it -- I like to be optimistic rather than pessimistic. And I would say I think we've made a significant good start down the road. SEN. SHELBY: Well, I think we've -- MS. HILL: We're not finished but, you know, I think we've done a fair amount of work here and we're getting -- we have a good record on the facts so far. SEN. SHELBY: But you're a veteran investigator, a veteran prosecutor, inspector general at DOD. We all know this and we have a lot of respect for you. But in any investigation, you don't know what's going to turn up next, do you? MS. HILL: Right. SEN. SHELBY: And you're not telling us here today and the American people that you see the end of this investigation. MS. HILL: No, I think I said previously, in response to another question, that in any investigation, the more you dig, you find things, and then you have to have time to go through those things. SEN. SHELBY: Analyze it. MS. HILL: And we are -- that has happened. It's happening, just like it happens in any investigation. And we're trying to follow those facts where they lead. Now, whether all of that will be finished by whenever this is determined to end, I don't know. But I think we'll make a significant contribution and will have made a good -- SEN. SHELBY: I think you're already making a significant contribution, and I think the staff is. My concern is that we don't know what we don't know. MS. HILL: Correct. SEN. SHELBY: And I have the feeling that there's more out there, because I raised this morning -- I raised the issue in opening statements that I don't believe, as a member of the committee, that we've had the utmost support by the agencies that we're investigating. And I don't believe that we've had the support that was promised at the outset, you know, by the administration. Having said that, I want to focus just what little time I have on the FBI. You may have talked about this earlier -- I know you addressed it -- and that is the analytical component of the FBI. MS. HILL: Right. SEN. SHELBY: We know that the FBI has got good people. We know that they're great on investigations. They have no peer, I believe. MS. HILL: Right. SEN. SHELBY: But on analysis of intelligence information, some of us have been on the committee -- and this is my eighth year here -- that we've been concerned with that for a long time. It's hard to put an intelligence division or component together and make it work. Tell us, in your judgment, what was the state of the analytical component of the FBI before September the 11th, from what you know? MS. HILL: Well, on terrorism, basically, yeah. SEN. SHELBY: As far as terrorism is concerned. MS. HILL: The FBI -- I mean, our figures -- we have the figures in the statement -- they, I think, had one individual working on al Qaeda -- SEN. SHELBY: One individual working al Qaeda before September the 11th in the analysis. MS. HILL: Analysis, right. And, you know, my own personal view -- and you alluded to it -- and I have worked with the FBI for many, many years -- SEN. SHELBY: I know you have. MS. HILL: -- starting when I was a prosecutor, and I agree with you. I think they are tremendous investigators. And in terms of law enforcement, they can be the best on some cases in prosecutions. But that's their mission. Their mission is to do an investigation, to do a prosecution, to do a case. If it's their case and their mission, their prosecution, they will go to the nth degree. And they're very aggressive, and we need that. But they are not -- at least in my experience, their training and their mission does not focus on going beyond that into the broader analytical world and looking at the big picture. They are focused on their case. And it's too bad, because their aggressiveness would be very good if they could also channel it, at least on issues like terrorism, a little broader onto the analytical. SEN. SHELBY: Well, before September 11th, they only had one person in the whole bureau working on that, you just testified to. Is that correct? On al Qaeda. MS. HILL: Yeah. And I just have a note from our staff, who has done a lot of these interviews, that it was at the FBI they had one individual doing strategic analysis is what we're talking about. SEN. SHELBY: That's right. MS. HILL: They did have some others that were doing, as she calls, operational analysis, which I interpret that to mean that was connected with prosecutions and cases. So there were individuals doing that. SEN. SHELBY: Do we think that there is a way to get the FBI changed, or at least part of it, toward strategic analysis of information dealing with terrorism in the future? I know we talked to the director about this. But that's harder to do than it is to say, isn't it? MS. HILL: Well, I think it's not only getting them to expand their focus. I mean, it's like any job or profession in an agency. They have to be able to give people incentives in terms of career and profession and those sorts of things to make the analysis positions in the FBI important positions, that people want to do. SEN. SHELBY: One of my lights is on. I guess I'll -- I'll wait another round, Mr. Chairman. REP. GOSS: Ms. Pelosi. REP. PELOSI: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I want to join others in commending Ms. Hill on the excellent work that she and the members of her very able staff have performed. I hope, I hope that it is a comfort to the families to know how persistent and thorough this staff is in this investigation, in this inquiry, however limited it is strictly to intelligence. And as was mentioned earlier, there are other agencies of government beyond the intelligence community that need some review as well. The question of could it have been prevented, of course, is one that will haunt us as long as we exist as a country. And there's no good answer. The good news is the bad news. If the answer is no, it could not have been prevented, that means we're very exposed in the future. If it means yes, it could have been prevented, that's good news because that bodes well for the future, but it's a tragedy, obviously, for the families. It's a tragedy in any event, but if it could have been prevented, we'll all be haunted by the guilt associated with that. And that's not even good enough punishment for us. There will be hell to -- that's going up to September 11th. Post-September 11th, if any of these agencies of government in the intelligence community are not dealing honestly with us -- and by that I mean being forthcoming with information -- if, as Mr. Shelby says, there's other information to come that we don't know about now, I believe there will be hell to pay for them, because we all assume that everyone is doing their best to protect our country, and they must help us get to the bottom of this. I trust that they are helping us all they can, but we must continue the inquiry. I think, as one who originally supported an independent commission -- I was original author of it, and we passed in committee; we failed on the floor -- the idea, I think, is an important one. However, it does not in any way undermine the important work of this inquiry. As Mr. Roemer has said and others have said, this piece of it that goes into the intelligence committee is very important. We could have had the best intelligence in the world, though, and what we found out was that, since September 11th, is that the hijackers and the al Qaeda knew something about us that we did not know about ourselves, and that is that we had tremendous exposure at the airports. That all four of these hijackings could have been successful is remarkable. I find it remarkable that maybe one would get by, but four of them to succeed -- in their words succeed -- is remarkable to me. So my question to you, Ms. Hill, is, on this subject your report is clear, but I would just like to see if you could shed some further light. As you were looking into this issue of the hijackers -- and we'll go more into it in a couple of days -- but did you see a distinction made between hijacking -- of course, tat's a predictable threat to us -- and using airplanes as weapons as two distinct threats? Because from our perspective, many of us, a hijacking is still the loss of many, many lives and should have been taken as seriously as hijacking with intent to do further damage. MS. HILL: Well, we certainly, when we went out looking for information and requesting information from the agencies, distinguished it, because we were asking for information on the use of aircraft as weapons. So that would imply more than the usual just hijack a plane to get somewhere or take hostages or whatever. But in terms of, you know, being prepared to address it and your comments about why, you know, why they were able to hijack all four of these plans and our defenses were down, there's probably less of a distinction. And I point to the FAA-FBI assessment that we quote in this staff statement. I think that year, which was, I believe, 2000, they were looking at the whole threat, terrorist threat, to civil aviation. So they were not distinguishing between aircrafts as weapons or hijacking. And what was interesting about it is that they were concluding that there was a small domestic threat, so they were not too concerned about any sort of terrorist threat to domestic U.S. aviation here in the United States as late as 2000. REP. PELOSI: Well, I find that to be a serious shortcoming -- MS. HILL: Right. REP. PELOSI: -- separate and apart from not knowing the time and place and date -- MS. HILL: Right. REP. PELOSI: -- the fact that the entire threat was minimized to that extent. So I do see the need, as I had said before, to assess the performance of any agency beyond the intelligence agencies, which have a responsibility to (protect?) acts of terrorism and to look with fresh eyes and some innovative thinking on our intelligence and all other aspects of protecting the American people in this regard. And, of course, as Senator Rockefeller said, we must do it right. But I think doing it right also means protecting our civil liberties. So we have quite a challenge. And your presentation this morning and the work of your staff has been a valuable contribution. Thank you. MS. HILL: Thank you. REP. PELOSI: I look forward to following hearings. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. SEN. GRAHAM: Thank you, Ms. Pelosi. Mr. Goss. REP. GOSS: Thank you. Let me advise members of the House that there's 10 minutes left on a vote in the House, so my wrap-up will be very quick. First of all, I want to thank Ms. Hill for a very excellent presentation. MS. HILL: Thank you. REP. GOSS: I liked the version that we had before it had been redacted better, and I expect that we are going to continue to press on, because I do believe that there is more that can be revealed. And along that area, is it fair for me to make a statement that because of the joint staff, we now know some things that we otherwise certainly would not have known? Is that a fair statement? MS. HILL: I would hope so, yes. I would say so. REP. GOSS: That is certainly my feeling as well. And I hope that much of that can be shared with the American people. The second question I wanted to ask or provide some guidance on, from my perspective, is in your excellent report this morning on intelligence reporting on bin Laden's intentions to strike inside the United States, on pages 14 and 15 of your report -- 15 and 16 -- were a series of specifics that cries out to say, ""Why was all this ignored? Where was the audience? Why was nobody listening?"" And one of the issues that I would like to have further amplification on this is if this was 2 percent of the reporting, what was the other 98 percent of the reporting that was consuming the analysts' time in the intelligence community? I'm not asking for an answer now. MS. HILL: Right. REP. GOSS: I think that is going to be helpful for our report. The next question, I think, is self-evident, and others have said it. There's no doubt that some of the questions members here have addressed today to you are more appropriate for witnesses that will be forthcoming, and I want to make sure that we understand that there will be other witnesses forthcoming and we will try and have as much of that as public as we can, as it should be. But the very penetrating questions that were asked by Ms. Breitweiser and Mr. Push and the recommendations, I think, are an excellent point, and each one of them deserves consideration, and we'll get them at some point. In fact, some of them have already been given consideration, as I'm sure you know. And finally, with regard to the remarks about Senator Levin and Senator Rockefeller on declassification, my view is that the burden is on the administration to tell us why we must preserve classification unless it's in those areas, those exempt areas that I spoke to -- sources, methods, plans and intentions, and ongoing prosecutions by the Justice Department. The final point I would make is that the work of this committee will be done. There is no question about that. And there will continue to be oversight by the United States Congress in a number of areas, including in the intelligence committees, no matter who the members are of that committee. So this is an issue that is not going to be dropped merely because another date flips up on a calendar or there is a change of personnel somewhere in the establishment. This will go forward because the American people deserve the answer and they will get the answer. And I thank you very much for your participation today, and an excellent job, Ms. Hill. MS. HILL: Thank you. REP. GOSS: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. SEN. GRAHAM: Thank you, Mr. Goss. Senator Feinstein. SEN. FEINSTEIN: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I certainly concur with the remarks that have been made about the excellence of the report. MS. HILL: Thank you. SEN. FEINSTEIN: I'm just sorry I couldn't get it until the meeting, so I had to spend my time reading it during the meeting, which, Mr. Chairman, I would suggest is not the best way of enabling us to carry out our duties. SEN. GRAHAM: Senator, as you know, we made the original non- redacted version available in both the House and the Senate Intelligence Committee rooms, and I understand that you took advantage of that. Unfortunately, it was only within the last less than 36 hours that we got back from the declassification agencies the version that we could make public. I hope that in the future we and they will do a better job and a more expeditious job so that will give us an opportunity to know what's going to be public with more lead time. SEN. FEINSTEIN: I thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ms. Hill, on December the 4th, 1998, the DCI told his deputies, in a memo about bin Laden and al Qaeda, that ""We are at war. I want no resources or people spared in this effort, either inside CIA or the community."" Yet in your testimony, you indicate that when it came time to translate that declaration of war into real resources, the government's efforts fell woefully short. Specifically you concluded that the allocation of intelligence community resources did not adequately reflect the true war against bin Laden. For example, you point out in 1999 the CTC at CIA had only three analysts assigned to the bin Laden network worldwide. And after 2000, that number had risen to just five and that things were even worse outside the CIA. The international terrorism analytic unit at the FBI had in place only one analyst to address al Qaeda -- this out of an intelligent budget of literally billions of dollars every year. Now, it really concerns me, because I was one that felt very strongly that the warnings that something was going to happen were there, and certainly by July I was -- just based on what I heard in this committee -- 100 percent certain that something was going to happen. I even said that on national television, that I thought it was going to happen within the next three months. And my question really goes to the fact that whether today even we have enough to do what we need to do -- why do you think so little attention, even after these declarations of war, were really paid when it came to devoting real resources, and what was taking a higher priority? MS. HILL: I -- I think -- we have asked that to many people in the community, and I will give you -- again, I have to be careful the details of it, because we are in a public session. But I think what we are hearing is that there were other priorities that the intelligence -- one reaction would be that people would tell you that the intelligence community responds to its customers -- customers being other parts of government that are tasking them to come up with intelligence on certain items, and that in some respects there were customers that they had to satisfy, they felt they had to satisfy and were told to satisfy on other topics other than al Qaeda. So that was one issue that we've heard. We have heard in the FBI on this -- the resources. There was -- as we just discussed with Senator Shelby, there was not many -- there was like one strategic analyst for al Qaeda in the FBI. There were some more analysts on operations, and there was a much bigger emphasis in the FBI on operations, on cases, investigations, as opposed to strategic analysis, even though it was on al Qaeda, which was a high threat. But their mission was more focused on actual prosecutions and cases. So I think as with any resource issue it was a question of other priorities, customers demanding other things, and the agencies responding to them. SEN. FEINSTEIN: Do you believe that today there are sufficient resources? MS. HILL: We have not, senator -- you know, we know some of the details as to how things have jumped since September 11th in terms of resources, but we have not focused intently on what is going on post- September 11th, because our job has been to try and find out what was happening before September 11th. So I wouldn't -- I really would not feel probably qualified to start guessing as to whether it's adequate now. SEN. FEINSTEIN: On page 15 -- SEN. GRAHAM: Senator, we will have another round after this round. SEN. FEINSTEIN: I don't even get the time our question took up. Never mind. Thank you. SEN. GRAHAM: Senator Mikulski. SEN. MIKULSKI: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, a few words to the families and then a question for Ms. Hill. To the families, first of all, my name is Barbara Mikulski. I am a United States senator, and I am from the state of Maryland. I had people die at the World Trade Center, and I also had 60 Marylanders die at the Pentagon in the plane and in the inferno there. I also believe I owe my life to the gallantry of the men and women who fought on 93, because I do believe the plane was heading towards us. And I have two constituents who died in the anthrax attack on us. So know that I am absolutely on your side. And I want you to know that I thank you today for coming, because you show such inspirational strength and courage, and I believe you have a right to know about what happened, you have a right to be heard in any public forum, and I believe Americans have a right to be protected. I know that you are still looking for answers on why this happened, how it happened, and how it doesn't happen again. Know I would support a vote to establish an independent commission. I believe my committee has done an outstanding job. But I believe when such an impact happens to America and its families, we need more than one opinion on how to make sure it never happens again. What I find -- I find many things about what happened troubling. But what I find most troubling is that four of the terrorists were stopped by local law enforcement -- four for speeding, and one for not having a driver's license. They were actually in the hands of law enforcement. But when they were stopped, and the police went to check the databases, nothing alerted them to detain these men. Something is wrong here. State troopers, like the one in my own state that stopped one of these thugs, and other police officers know more when they check their database, know more about men being behind in their child support -- the database will tell them -- than they do about men who are possibly around a terrorist attack. There are more than 50 different watch lists to keep track of people dangerous to the United States. But, guess what, if you are a watch list, you don't talk to other watch lists. If you are a watch list, you like live in one of those caves. You might not know if there are other watch lists out there. You don't tell anyone that you are a watch list, and you certainly don't talk to each other, make friends with the other watch list, or make friends with law enforcement. That's really I think unacceptable. And these will be the questions I am going to direct to Ms. Hill, because like you I want to be sure that this committee gets answers for you and the rest of America on how we can detect, deter, disrupt and defeat any attack on the United States of America. And, having said that, Ms. Hill, you know about these watch lists -- you know that they are all over the place and they are nowhere. In our work with you and my colleagues, I wanted to see if there was a smoking gun. I wanted to know what were the systemic problems and what were the solutions. I am not sure there is a smoking gun, but these watch lists are definitely a systemic problem. Could you elaborate them, the ones you can, or where you would see solutions are going on the watch lists? MS. HILL: The watch list issue, senator, we are -- I am aware of it. We are going to go into that in more detail when we get to the hearing on the hijackers, because as you alluded to that is an issue regarding Midhar and Alhamzi. I mean, that's a very big issue. It's an issue of getting it on the right watch list, getting it to the right people. But, even before that, it's also an issue of getting it between the intelligence community and the law enforcement community, and breaking down the reluctance sometimes to share information across the -- from the intelligence community to the criminal investigators and law enforcement on the other side. And that I think may also play on some of this. So, but those are issues that we will talk about when we look at the hijacker case. And, you are right, they are a problem. SEN. MIKULSKI: Well, let me just say this before the yellow goes to red: I raised the issue of a smoking gun. I have been in many hearings. Do you believe that there is a smoking gun on what went wrong, or was it just a series of total disconnects? MS. HILL: Well, we -- of course I am handicapped in answering that, because we are in a public session and we are still looking at a number of other issues that have come up. But I don't think in any of what we have seen here, smoking gun -- if you mean by smoking gun that somebody had information of when, where, how this was going to happen in the United States government -- we have not found that. But, you know, I had a discussion -- actually with one of our staff -- on this the other day, and he pointed out wisely that there has been so much discussion about looking for a smoking gun. The truth is you hardly ever get a, quote, ""smoking gun"" in not just terrorism, but in a criminal case, et cetera, et cetera. And if by focusing all the time on we have the smoking gun, you know, we have to be ready to go if we have a smoking gun, the truth is most of the time you will never have a smoking gun, and it is a lot harder to find it when you don't have one. So what we ought to be focusing on is how to get our system ready to find these guys when you don't have a smoking gun, which is what you are going to be faced with most of the time, just -- you know, the odds are you are not going to have that. And we need to have our intelligence and law enforcement people good enough and bright enough and aggressive enough that they can track these guys down and find this, even when there is no smoking gun, because my own experience at least in law enforcement is that's what you have most of the time. SEN. MIKULSKI: Thank you. SEN. GRAHAM: Thank you, senator. Senator Kyl. And Senator Kyl has submitted an opening statement which will be placed in the record. SEN. KYL: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. By the way, I think that last point is a very important point that needs to be underscored, and it's one of the most important things that comes from this -- from your statement today, Ms. Hill. MS. HILL: Thank you, senator. SEN. KYL: I was this morning detained in my office waiting for a couple of phone calls, but I had my television on the entire time, and was privileged to hear not only the statements of the chairman of our committee, but also the statements made by Ms. Breitweiser and Mr. Push. And as has been expressed by others here, my heart goes out to them and the families and families that they represent. And I think that I should state that I am certain that every American shares their grief and their anger, and even their frustration. And I also share their view that there's more we could have done to try to prevent the terrorism we experienced on September 11th. I also agree with Eleanor Hill that at the end of the day it is doubtful we will ever find a smoking gun. But, as she said, the important point is to be in a better position to deal with the other pieces of information in order to try to prevent this in the future. I do think, Mr. Chairman, that it is very unclear whether the joint investigation -- the joint committee investigation that we are engaged in here, and whatever report we eventually submit will satisfy these witnesses and those that they represent, or whether they will satisfy members of this committee, let alone the other members of the House and the Senate. As you know, Mr. Chairman, I have expressed serious reservations about the direction of our investigation, including the allocation of time and resources to holding open hearings at this time before we have finished our work. Ours is a large undertaking, and we have got a lot more work to do before our fast-approaching deadline. And yet we are proceeding with public hearings, in spite of not having completed that investigation. What was presented today was only a staff document -- I am talking now about the testimony of Ms. Hill. It was not a consensus product. The committee members had no practical input into this interim report -- I think the public should know. Ordinarily we investigate, we write our report, and then we present our recommendations. The staff's presentation of its interim report before member vetting is therefore in my view premature as well as a diversion of the joint staff from the investigation that we have given them the job to do. The interim statement from our joint inquiry staff provides some very valuable information about what has been done to date -- a chronology of events leading to the September 11th attacks and some background information about the growing threat of al Qaeda over the last decade. It is very useful to have this history, and it's important to make it public. But the committee should have approved it first. And in any event, the release of the report could have been done without taking the time to have it read by the staff director. But, more importantly, I believe that questions fundamental to our investigation have yet to be pursued adequately. These include -- include, but are not limited to -- whether part of the pre-September 11th problem was a result of a culture of risk aversion in the intelligence community, and/or an inadequate allocation and improper prioritization of resources to those on the front lines of our counterterror efforts. Mr. Chairman, you know I have expressed before my concern that committee members have been able to play only a limited role in this inquiry. It's largely being conducted by the joint committee staff with little input by or to our own committee staffs, let alone the members themselves. And that will make it difficult to concur in the final product without reservations. We will not know what we haven't been told; and therefore we will not be able to vouch unequivocally for the final product. Questions about this investigative process have led to calls for the creation of a national commission to investigate all of these matters. This would further stress the intelligence community at the very time we are trying to fight the war on terrorism. While it may be deemed necessary, it can hardly be deemed desirable. So I hope, Mr. Chairman, that we can continue to work to resolve these issues. Only by doing our very best will we have done our duty to the victims who are represented here today, and to the American people. SEN. GRAHAM: Senator, thank you. Senator Bayh is supposed to be en route. If Senator Shelby has -- SEN. SHELBY: If you will let me ask until he comes. SEN. GRAHAM: And then I have a couple of questions I am going to ask at the conclusion of Senator Bayh's questions. Senator Shelby. SEN. SHELBY: Mrs. Hill, I would like to go back to the FBI and the analytical component we were talking about earlier -- MS. HILL: Right, right. SEN. SHELBY: -- or lack thereof. In your investigation regarding the analytical ability of the FBI, do you know if the FBI prior to September the 11th ever did an analysis of terrorist tactics? That is, terrorist tactics with the possible use of airplanes as weapons? MS. HILL: I don't believe so. We -- as I think -- SEN. SHELBY: You're saying no -- MS. HILL: As the statement says, we haven't found any analysis of the use of aircraft as weapons in the community, as far as I know, including the FBI. SEN. SHELBY: In the community -- you are talking about the intelligence community -- MS. HILL: Yeah, but we would include -- SEN. SHELBY: Not just the FBI? MS. HILL: Right. I think it's safe to say the FBI also. SEN. SHELBY: Now, in your statement -- I believe it's on page 28 -- not without reading it all -- and I'll quote some of it. It says, ""In April 2000, the intelligence community obtained information regarding an alleged bin Laden threat to hijack a 747. The source was a walk-in to the FBI's Newark office, claiming that he had been to a training camp in Pakistan, where he learned hijacking techniques and received arms training. He also stated that he was supposed to meet five or six other individuals in the U.S. who would participate in the plot."" And I'll read further: ""They were instructed to use all necessary force to take over the plane, because there would be pilots among the hijacking team. The plan was to fly the plane to Afghanistan, and if they could not make it there they would blow up the plane."" This is part of your report -- is that right? MS. HILL: Right. SEN. SHELBY: Now, were they -- I believe there was another report, August 2001, according to page 28 of your report, ""In August of 2001, the intelligence community obtained information regarding a plot to either bomb the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi from an airplane, or crash an airplane into it. The intelligence community learned that two people who were reportedly acting on instructions from bin Laden met in October 2000 to discuss this plot."" And then we go back and you've touched on this, I believe. I know we've had hearings on it. About the Philippine '95 situation. MS. HILL: Right. SEN. SHELBY: Where there was information that they could use airplanes as weapons and so forth. MS. HILL: Right, correct. SEN. SHELBY: In the light of part of your statement I just referred to , you're saying that they're -- according to your investigation, there was not any analysis of these terrorist tactics in the intelligence community, regarding the -- MS. HILL: There was no -- there was no analysis of the likelihood of the use of airplanes as weapons as a terrorist tactic. SEN. SHELBY: I wonder why not. MS. HILL: I would hypothesize that what -- I mean when we we've asked questions of people. It's a resource issue. People say they were overwhelmed. The other thing, and I mentioned this earlier, I don't think anyone had pulled as we did, I mean the reason, the way we got this information is by going to the agencies and saying we want everything you have on the use of aircraft as weapons. So we have then pulled out of this huge amount of data they have and come up with enough to show that there was this trend and this theme going through some of the reporting. SEN. SHELBY: This was not on September 11th something new or shouldn't have been something new. This was stuff that had been out there at least since '95, before then, and I believe you talked about the Paris incident where the French -- MS. HILL: The Eiffel Tower. SEN. SHELBY: Oh, yeah, the Eiffel Tower deal, the Philippine deal, these reporting that you listed. So when people come up and they say, ""Gosh, we were shocked that they would use weapons, use airplanes as weapons, and we didn't do any analysis of that in the community,"" are you kind of shocked or surprised? MS. HILL: Well, it was there. I mean, the information was there. SEN. SHELBY: The information was there if they had it analyzed as far as the potential tactics of the hijackers, is that right? MS. HILL: Yeah. I mean, based on what we've seen this was not a new idea as of September 11th. SEN. SHELBY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. SEN. GRAHAM: Senator Durbin. SEN. RICHARD DURBIN (D-IL): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I apologize for not being here earlier, but I had a Judiciary Committee hearing, which ran in conflict with this hearing today. And I thank you, Mr. Chairman, Senator Shelby and our counterparts in the House for the time that we put into this effort and your leadership in bringing us to this moment. I personally feel that we have identified some things of value in terms of shortcomings from the government's point of view prior to September 11th. We have identified a lack of communication among the intelligence agencies, and I'm afraid that today, although there's been an improvement, there is still much room for improvement. I have focused primarily on the issue of information technology and I have been chagrined and disappointed by the reports about the lack of coordination of the computer architecture of the federal government so that agencies, intelligence agencies can share information effectively. Governor Ridge referred to this as a force multiplier, and it would be, but it is not because of those shortcomings. We have also considered the results of those shortcomings, and not the least of which was the example of the Phoenix memo, which should have been but was not brought to the attention of or analyzed by counter-terrorism forces. That memo might -- might have at least helped us to be better prepared for what occurred on September 11th, though I don't want to suggest that anyone saw this coming in its specifics, but it's certainly raised questions, which should have been pursued and were not. I think recalling some of the testimony we received there was clearly a lack of follow-up at the FBI and a lack of involvement by the CIA. The same thing holds true for the Moussaoui arrest and the disclosures that came out of the FBI afterwards, again evidencing a lack of coordination, a lack of sharing of vital information that could have had us better prepared to defend America. Those two instances though I would like to bring to the attention of this joint inquiry have come to the public eye because of leaks, leaks by the administration, leaks from Capitol Hill of vital information. It strikes me as unwise and unfair for us to expect there to be a thorough investigation of what led up to September 11th based on the possibility of leaks coming from anywhere. History has told us that it is far better to have a public hearing, a public investigation and the involvement of third parties when it comes to assigning blame and perhaps suggesting meaningful and painful reforms, but that has not been the case here. I think we are doing what we set out to do, to try to find ways to improve the workings of the intelligence community to avoid a future September 11th, but we will never be able to satisfy the needs and curiosity of the American people about whether their government did everything it could to protect them in closed hearings with occasional leaks. That is not going to serve the needs of America. (Applause.) I know that earlier today there was testimony of one of the widows of a victim of September 11th and I have met in my office with some of those same victims and the families in painful meetings. There is an anger and a sadness in the message that they bring to Congress, but there is certainly I think wisdom in what they've suggested: Let us do our business here, let us try to find even within closed hearings ways to improve the intelligence committee and community, but let's not forget our primary obligation to the people of this country. We do not serve the needs of an open society with closed hearings in relation to an attack on America virtually unprecedented in our history. It is time for us to acknowledge the obvious: We need a third party investigation, people that we can trust, who have no political animus, who are going to come to this as loyal Americans to try to help us be a safer nation. I commend the staff. They have done heroic work and I know have worked long and hard to bring the report that we have today. And we should continue to meet our mandate as best we can, but let us not believe that this chapter has been closed in American history. We have merely addressed the forward with this investigation; now we must get into the substance and do it in a public way. That's not to diminish any of the efforts of my colleagues or anyone on this committee, but I think we owe it to the American people to give them more. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. SEN. GRAHAM: I would like to ask a question and then make a comment. The question has to do with the relationship between intelligence and effecting the operation of a governmental agency. You have five or more pages in which you outline the examples of the use of commercial aviation as a weapon of mass destruction. As I understand the history, generally the taking of an airplane by hijackers has been done for either a political or an economic purpose, that in light of that the standard protocol, what a crew is supposed to do if they are subjected to hijacking is to cooperate, to acquiesce, to try to get the airplane on the ground and then start the process of negotiating with the hijackers. From your review, is that an accurate statement? MS. HILL: Yes, I think that's correct, and that was traditionally the way you would deal with a hijacking. SEN. GRAHAM: And I believe it was reflected in the way in which the first three planes that were hijacked on September 11th reacted. It was not until the information of the first three planes became known to the persons on the fourth plane that there was a resistance to the hijackers and as a result the plane crashed in Pennsylvania. With the kind of intelligence information that there might be a shift in the way in which hijackers and aircraft interrelated, that is instead of taking the airplane for a political or economic purpose, that the plane itself might be converted into a weapon and used in the horrific manner that it was. Was that information from the intelligence community transmitted to either the FAA or the commercial aviation industry so that it might affect the way in which they advise crews as to how to respond to a hijacking? MS. HILL: I can't say that all that information was transmitted to the FAA. The FAA did get some of it, and we talk about their analysis of the threat to civil aviation. My own read on it is I don't think that to the extent the FAA got the information there was a real recognition that this was a serious threat. I mean, certainly you're correct. I mean, if they had changed their focus from hijacking for ransom or to take the plane and fly it somewhere else or hostages or whatever, if that had changed to the use of an aircraft as a weapon, you would have had to change the entire mindset and training that was given to the flight crews, for instance, and the security in the plane and everything, and that obviously did not happen because as of September 11th, you're absolutely correct, it didn't happen on September 11th until evidently the passengers in the fourth plane became aware of what was going on, but that was not, the flight crews up to that point I assume were following the standard protocol for dealing with a hijacking. But that issue underscores the importance of someone recognizing in the community, the intelligence community that this was a serious threat and there was a stream of information there and that perhaps it was serious enough and the likelihood was serious enough that they needed to address not only disseminating it but telling policymakers in those other agencies that this was a threat they now had to be prepared to meet. SEN. GRAHAM: One of my criticisms of the threats that are being issued to the general public, including the one within the last two weeks, is that what's lacking is the follow-on of what is the citizen who receives this information that they're living in a heightened threat environment supposed to do to protect themselves, their families, their communities. And here we have a case of where intelligence information was sent to a sophisticated industry, commercial aviation apparently without any direction as to how the industry should use the information and the consequence was they didn't use the information and that contributed to what happened on September 11th. I'd like to ask if we might pursue that issue, because I think it is a metaphor for the larger issue of how do you get intelligence from the theoretical to actually affecting the way people function and how they use that information to reduce their vulnerability to a particular threat. Senator Feinstein? SENATOR FEINSTEIN: I think Senator DeWine was before me, Mr. Chairman. SEN. GRAHAM: Oh, I'm sorry. Senator DeWine. I'm sorry. SEN. DEWINE: Mr. Chairman, I don't have any further questions. Thank you. SEN. GRAHAM: Senator Feinstein? SEN. FEINSTEIN: May I, Mr. Chairman? Ms. Hill? MS. HILL: Yes, Senator. SEN. FEINSTEIN: I wanted to kind of follow-up on where I was trying to go with this. The year 2001 was a very big year in the early spring with a lot of pieces of intelligence coming in. In reading your report, the year 1998 also appears to have been a very big year for all kinds of pieces. And I wanted to see if we couldn't go into some of those pieces a little bit more. There contained on page 15 on your written statement you talk about the use of fronts for terrorist activities, talk about flying an aircraft loaded with explosives into an airport and detonating it. Al-Qaeda was trying to establish an operative cell within the United States. A bin Laden plot involving aircraft in New York and Washington. Recruiting a group of five to seven young men from the United States to travel to the Middle East for training. Reward money for assassinations of four top intelligence agency officers and on like that. And then, of course the war that was declared in the CIA. MS. HILL: Right. SEN. FEINSTEIN: Can you go into any more detail on any of these individual pieces of intelligence and how they were used from an intelligence perspective to try to weave an intelligence web? Because it seems to me with this and then unfortunately in July of 2001 with the Phoenix memo and then in August with Moussaoui, and I don't know what was in his computer or in his possession, but I would suggest if you took those pieces and the other pieces one might be able to weave together a rather significant scheme. Can you give us any more information? MS. HILL: I can't. I don't think I can give you more information on the actual report because, as I mentioned at the outset, the language that we have in this statement is what has been declassified. So to venture beyond that language, that is the language that the declassification group basically signed off on as suitable for public release. I can't go into much more detail about the language of the report. We did go on some of these to the FBI and asked them what they did with some of this information or what happened to it when the report came in, if they got it, and I can tell you some of them, and we've given them a whole list, and some we still have not gotten responses. They are still trying to find out what they did or locate the record. Others they have found. For instance, I think you mentioned the 1998 information concerning a bin Laden plot involving aircraft in New York and Washington. The FBI, I can tell you, did receive that information and they worked actually with local law enforcement to try to verify the report, but they were not able to corroborate the report and took no further action is what we have been told. In September '98 we had one where we did get a response from the FBI. This was the one about that they obtained information that bin Laden's next operation could involve flying an aircraft loaded with explosives into a U.S. airport and detonating it. We asked the FBI if they got that information and what did they do with it. They did receive the information and they also worked with another agency, government agency to try to verify the information. The source of the information said that another individual had advanced knowledge of some of bin Laden's operations and had given him the information about bin Laden's attack or this report. The FBI tells us that they tried to work with other agencies and did verify portions of this account, but they were not able to locate the individual who reportedly had the advanced knowledge. And after September 11th they actually went back to this report and tried to locate that individual again and were unable to do so. So what we tried to do when we got these reports that we felt were significant was we tried -- particularly the ones, there were many in 1998 involving domestic U.S. attacks and on those we went back to the FBI, as I said, and have asked them, ""Did you get the report, what did you do to verify it or did you take any action,"" and they have come back to us on some of them. Some of them, there are a number of them, they are still trying to go through their records and come up with an answer as to whether they got it and if so what they did with it. But those two are examples of the type of thing we're getting from them. SEN. FEINSTEIN: Thank you. Mr. Chairman, just one quick comment, if I might. I think this report becomes kind of a basic primer on 9/11. I'm sure more will be filled in as time goes on, but I find it a very valuable document in establishing a chronology of what was known, when it was known, the fragmentary messages that come through here and my hope is as these hearings go on and particularly when we get to the Phoenix memo and the Moussaoui case that we might be able to ask some questions and I don't know in public session if we will about if there had been a FISA warrant on Moussaoui and the information made available, whether that would have been substantial enough to really ring a very strong bell. But I wanted to thank the staff and Ms. Hill and also thank the victims who were here today. It's very special and I hope you know that we really do care and that you really do have our sympathy and our determination to get at the heart of it. SEN. GRAHAM: And, Senator, I share those comments and I would say that within the next week or ten days we will have a further specific hearing on the issues that surround the Moussaoui case and that would be a very excellent opportunity to bore in at the level of detail that you've indicated your interested in. I didn't get a chance in my first round to make my comments, so I will do so unless anyone -- does anyone have any remaining questions? So this will be the last word. To me, one of the lessons that we have been learning and today we learned it at a new depth is how difficult it is to get an organization, which has been doing its business, important business in a particular pattern for an extended period of time, to be flexible enough to recognize that the environment has shifted and it is going to have to change its pattern of business. In the case of the intelligence agencies they were a child born in 1947 and grew up in the Cold War. Every experience that the U.S. intelligence service had was a post-1947 experience because we didn't have any civilian intelligence service in the United States prior to 1947. I contrast that with, for instance, the British who have had an intelligence service since the Napoleonic Wars. So it is not surprising that when the Cold War ended the agencies continued to act pretty much the way they did while the Cold War was still underway because that was the only environment in which they'd ever functioned or known. We've had some examples I think in the report that Ms. Hill has given us today, the difficulty in reestablishing priority. Even though we declared that terrorism and Osama bin Laden specifically was such an adversary that we were at war with him, we didn't change resources commensurate with that decision. We did not recognize that terrorism was now becoming a domestic threat because historically we thought of terrorism as something that happened abroad and the new creative uses that the hijackers were about to make of commercial airliners. No longer were they passive instruments to try to use to secure money or some political advantage; they had themselves become a weapon of mass destruction. So I see as one of our challenges as we move from what we are learning to what we are going to prescribe for the future is to how can we build in to our intelligence community a greater capability of internal adapting. We certainly don't want to leave this issue for the future that will require a repetition of September the 11th to get to grab us by the sleeves and say, you know, you've got to change because your old ways are threatening the security of the American people. And how we go about doing that I suggest will be one of our major tasks, and if we are successful one of our major accomplishments. If there is no further statement, as I indicated earlier, the record will be open for 48 hours if anyone has any additional material they would like to submit. I want to especially thank the families who are represented here today and especially to Kristen, who I see is still with us and also Stephen for their excellent presentations, which started our public hearings with the appropriate recognition of why we are here, and we are here because of you. Thank you. SEN. SHELBY: Mr. Chairman, what's the schedule for the rest of the week? SEN. GRAHAM: Ms. Hill, do you want to review tomorrow? MS. HILL: I believe tomorrow we are going to have a public hearing in this room beginning at 10:00 and there will be two panels of users of intelligence products from the intelligence community and those users will be senior government officials over several administrations. I believe tomorrow we will have Mr. Wolfowitz, the deputy secretary of defense, Mr. Armitage, the deputy secretary of state, Brent Scowcroft, former National Security Advisory, Tony Lake, former National Security Advisory, and Sandy Berger, former National Security Advisor. SEN. SHELBY.: Will we start at 10:00? MS. HILL: 10:00. SEN. GRAHAM: We'll start at 10:00 and assuming that the stars line up properly and we can accomplish this, our goal would be to complete the first panel, which will be Mr. Wolfowitz and Mr. Armitage, in approximately three hours, have a break and then return at 2:30 and have the second panel run approximately another -- I'm corrected. The second panel is going to start at 2:00 so that we can try to finish at approximately 5:00 with both panels. MS. HILL: That's correct. SEN. GRAHAM: Are we at a point, Ms. Hill, we can comment on Friday yet? MS. HILL: I think we're still engaged in ongoing discussions on Friday. SEN. GRAHAM: Okay, thank you. The hearing is adjourned. END. PANEL II OF A JOINT HEARING OF THE SENATE AND HOUSE SELECT INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE SUBJECT: EVENTS SURROUNDING SEPTEMBER 11TH CO-CHAIRED BY: SENATOR DONALD GRAHAM (D-FL); AND REP.

HILL: Good morning, senator. Good morning, Chairman Graham, Chairman Goss, members of these committees. Before I proceed with my statement, I have a long written statement which I would like to submit for the record, and I am going to orally summarize it, given the length of what we have here. SEN. GRAHAM: Your full statement will appear in the record. MS. HILL: Thank you. But before I get into the main part of the statement, I do want to make clear to you and members of the committee that the information that is in this statement that we are going to present this morning has been cleared for public release. And, as I think most of you know, much of the information that our staff has been working on over the last several months is obviously highly classified, or has been highly classified. In the course of the last two months, we have been working with the intelligence community in a long, and what I would call a very arduous process, to declassify much of the information that we have reviewed and that we believe is important to the public's understanding of why the intelligence community did not know of the September 11th attacks in advance. And I would point out that that process -- we want to say for the record that we appreciate the many long hours that have been put into that process, in what I believe for the most part has been very constructive cooperation with the executive branch on that process. A good number of professionals from the community have been in working groups and have gone over with our staff the details of this information, to put it in a form where it could be released publicly. So there have -- we have made very good progress. But I do need to report that by late last night we were able to resolve all but two issues about relevant information -- two issues where we believed relevant information to the inquiry has not yet, despite our discussions with the executive branch, been declassified. And I want to make reference to those two issues, because this statement has been prepared, recognizing that those two areas remain classified. The two areas are any references to the intelligence community providing information to the president or the White House, and the identity of and information on a key al Qaeda leader involved in the September 11th attacks. According to the White House and the DCI, director of central intelligence, the president's knowledge of intelligence information relevant to this inquiry remains classified, even when the substance of that intelligence information has been declassified. With respect to the key al Qaeda leader involved in the September 11th attacks, I am advised this morning that the White House, and not the DCI, has declined to declassify his identity, despite an enormous volume of media reporting on this individual that has been out there for some time. The joint inquiry staff disagrees on both of those issues. We believe the public has an interest in this information, and that public disclosure would not harm national security. However, as I believe you know, we do not have the independent authority to declassify intelligence information short of a lengthy procedure in the U.S. Congress. And we therefore have prepared this statement without detailed descriptions of our work in those two areas. REP. TIM ROEMER (D-IN): Mr. Chairman? A parliamentary inquiry. SEN. GRAHAM: Mr. Roemer. REP. ROEMER: Are the committees bound by the classification decisions made in these two instances? SEN. GRAHAM: It is our advice from staff director and counsel that we do not independently have the authority to declassify material, and therefore we are constrained by the decisions made by those who have that legal responsibility. REP. ROEMER: A further parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Chairman. Is there a process then that either the committee or the Congress can undertake to challenge a classification decision such as that? SEN. GRAHAM: The answer is yes. And I would like -- Ms. Hill alluded to the fact that there was such a process. I think she described it as being cumbersome. If you or counsel might briefly explain what the option is to Congress. MS. HILL: Mr. Chairman, I am not an expert on the committee process. As I understand it, from speaking with the full committee counsel on this, it is -- it would require the Congress to -- you would have to have a vote -- I am not sure the full Congress or the Senate or House -- but there's a vote involved. You would have to run it through. The Congress itself would have to override that classification decision. The reason that we did not originate this information under the classification decision, the agency that originates it makes the classification and declassifies it. And in this instance that would not be the Congress. So the only alternative would be to go through this rather what I am told is a lengthy, rather prolonged process. I should point out that right before the hearing this morning I was advised by the White House that they were going to look at these two issues again, and they thought they would review it again within the next 48 hours. And I advised them that if their position changes please to advise the committees, and we could always issue a supplemental statement on those two issues for the record. So I -- my assumption is they are still reviewing it. REP. ROEMER: A final parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Chairman. Does the chairman intend to have this committee consider or debate that kind of process? I am not advocating that we challenge it at this point, but certainly understanding more from the joint inquiry staff that strongly disagrees with the decision as to why it might be helpful in a deliberative sense for the committee? SEN. GRAHAM: I think there are two questions in your inquiry. One is whether we might consider utilizing the currently existing process in this or future instances in which we have a disagreement as to whether the information which is being withheld is in fact classified information; i.e., that it relates to the national security. The second question might be as part of our final report we might want to recommend to our colleagues a change in the law that relates to the congressional role in declassification, so that it would be more available as an alternative in the event that there was a disagreement between Congress and an executive classifying agency. REP. ROEMER: Well, Mr. Chairman, thank you. I hope we do have a robust discussion of this, and I appreciate your patience. REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): Mr. Chairman? SEN. GRAHAM: Yes, Ms. Pelosi? REP. PELOSI: Mr. Chairman, I wish -- thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to join you in your earlier comments commending Eleanor Hill and Rick Sikagon (ph) and the joint inquiry staff for their fine work. And I want to inquire if it's possible just on this point, that the parliamentary inquiry that Mr. Roemer brought up. If Ms. Hill could just clarify -- it says any reference to the intelligence community providing information to the president or the White House. Could you give us an example of that? MS. HILL: What we are referring to, it's obvious and it's clear as you go through this statement that I am about to present, that we are talking about a number of intelligence reports which we have had declassified through this process. And part of our role was not just looking at what was the reporting, but where the reporting went. And you will note that this statement includes many intelligence reports, and in some instances they were provided to ""senior government officials,"" I believe is the wording that's used. But there is no reference on any of the pages as to whether the president received that information or not. And we have been told that that information -- in other words, not what is in the report but whether or not it went to the president -- would be classified under this decision. REP. PELOSI: And when you say the president, you mean any president historically. MS. HILL: That's correct. And clearly, if you look at the statement, the reporting has dates on it and the reporting is not just reporting that would have been under the current administration, but also reporting that was made under the prior administration. And the decision, in fairness, obviously, to the White House, it is not simply as to this sitting president but as to any president. REP. PELOSI: Well, I would hope, Mr. Chairman, whoever is presiding here, that Mr. Roemer's comments will be taken seriously by the chairman and that the committee should consider their options under existing committee rules to make this information public, depending on how it goes in the next 48 hours. And I would -- I think that the White House should be aware that there is strong interest among many of us to have this be the most open process possible, in fairness to those families who were affected, we heard from this morning, and really in the interest of a democratic society. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. REP. LAHOOD: Mr. Chairman? REP. GOSS: Chairman Graham had to step out for a moment; he'll be back. But I assure you, Ms. Pelosi, that he will be attentive to that request, as will I. Is it a point of inquiry or on this matter? REP. LAHOOD: On this matter. REP. GOSS: Mr. LaHood. REP. LAHOOD: Mr. Chairman, I wonder if the two chairmen could approach the White House within the next 48 hours, since they have this under consideration, to encourage them to make this information public and to relay the will of -- I believe it's the will of the joint committee that, based on what our staff director has said, that this information is important to be released. And it sounds like they're trying to make a political decision. And we would -- the joint committee would encourage them to release the information. I say that because it's under consideration, and I think it's important, particularly given the testimony that was provided by the first two witnesses. Thank you. REP. GOSS: Thank you, Mr. LaHood. I assure you that this is not a matter of first impression for the two chairmen or actually the four of us. We have made this case before. And just so all members of the committee and the public will know, there are approximately generalized areas that we feel there is legitimacy to withhold information to the public. Otherwise we feel the burden is on to the administration to prove to us why we should not give it to the public. We take the position the public deserves it. Those three exceptions are, of course, sources and methods, particularly those still active; plans and intentions -- that would be involving any actions we might take which might put our personnel at harm by giving advance information about what they're up to; and the third area is in the active prosecutions ongoing by the Department of Justice. We don't want to in any way mess up a prosecution that is going forward by saying something inadvertent that would create a problem for the prosecution. I think, other than those three areas, the public has a right to know and a need to know, because part of the reason we're going public hear is the awareness curve of what this enemy looks like, what they can do to us, and why we need to have a better system and why we are going to be asking for the support of our constituency, the American people, to give us a better intelligence system and all that that means. I hope that's a satisfactory answer. And your request is duly noted and will be dealt with. Would you please proceed after I advise the members that we have about 12 minutes left on a vote in the House? Is it one vote or two? Do we know? I believe it is one vote. Do members of the Senate wish to continue? SEN. FEINSTEIN: Mr. Chairman? Mr. Chairman? REP. GOSS: Yes, Senator. SEN. FEINSTEIN: Might I ask a question? Will there be a brief recess over the lunch hour for those of us that have commitments? REP. GOSS: It had been intended that there would not be, and I would suggest that when Senator Graham comes back, that you confer with him on that. The members of the House are now going to vote, and we will be away for about 20 minutes. And perhaps in that time you can decide how you wish to carry forward. SEN. SHELBY: Mr. Chairman, do you want us to wait and suspend the hearing? Because you won't have the benefit of her testimony. REP. GOSS: What is the view of the members? Do you want them to suspend or -- SEN. SHELBY: Till you get back. I think so. SEN. GRAHAM: The hearing will suspend until the members of the House return. (Recess.) SEN. GRAHAM: Call the hearing back to order. Ms. Eleanor Hill was in the early stages of providing us with the report of the joint inquiry staff. For purposes of people's schedules, it is our plan after Ms. Hill completes her statement to them call upon members in the order in which they arrived for five minutes of either questions or comments. I recognize that we will be running through the lunch hour. If members have to leave for previous commitments, or the pangs of hunger become overwhelming, they are encouraged to do so, but also encouraged to return so that they can have their opportunity to ask questions or make their comments. Ms. Hill. MS. HILL: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. SEN. FEINSTEIN: Excuse me. Mr. Chairman, could you read the list so we might know where we are? SEN. GRAHAM: Yes ma'am. The -- after the -- the chairs and vice chairs, they are in this order: Senator DeWine, Congressman Boehlert, Senator Wyden, Congressman Bereuter, Congressman Bishop, Senator Levin, Senator Inhofe, Congressman Peterson, Congressman Cramer, Congressman Boswell, Congressman Castle, Congressman Roemer, Congresswoman Harman, Congressman Burr, Senator Bayh, Senator Rockefeller, Senator Feinstein, Senator Mikulski, Congressman LaHood, Congressman Hoekstra, Senator Edwards, Congressman Gibbons, Congressman Everett. SEN. INHOFE (?): Mr. Chairman? SEN. GRAHAM: Yes. SEN. INHOFE (?): Would it be appropriate to ask unanimous consent of the members that if individuals do have to leave, if they have statements, that they could be included as part of the record. SEN. GRAHAM: It will be included in the record. SEN INHOFE (?): I thank the chair. SEN. GRAHAM: Are there any other comments before we return to Ms. Hill? Ms. Hill. MS. HILL: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Before I forget, I do want to ask that we have two versions of this statement -- it's the same statement but we have two copies, one of which has been signed and certified as releasable, cleared for public release by the chair of the declassification working group for the intelligence community, and each page has been initialed by that individual. And the second copy that I would also like to make available and part of the record is a similar copy that was signed and certified by the representative of the Department of Justice and initialed indicating that they agreed and concurred that it was suitable for public release, because, as you know, the Justice Department has some litigation concerns, ongoing cases. So, I'd ask that those be made part of the record. SEN. GRAHAM: Without objection. MS. HILL: Okay. I appreciate the opportunity to appear here today to advise the committees and the American public on the progress to date of the joint inquiry staff's review of the activities of the U.S. intelligence community in connection with the September 11th terrorist attacks on the United States. As the horror and sheer inhumanity of that day engulfed this nation, all of us struggled with shock, with the utter disbelief, and the inevitable search for answers. The questions, if not the answers, were obvious. How could we have been so surprised? What did our government, especially our intelligence agencies, know before September 11th, 2001? Why didn't they know more? What can we do to strengthen and improve the capabilities of our intelligence agencies and as a result help save ourselves and our children from ever having to face this again? On February 14th, 2002, the leadership of these two committees announced their resolve to come together to find credible answers to those sobering but critically important questions. The committees joined in an unprecedented, bicameral and bipartisan joint inquiry effort to meet that challenge. To conduct the review, the committees assembled a single staff that we call the joint inquiry staff, of 24 highly skilled professionals with experience in such areas as intelligence collection, analysis, management, law enforcement, investigations, and oversight. My testimony this morning is intended to address the inquiry's initial task, which was to conduct a factual review of what the intelligence community knew, or should have known, prior to September 11th, 2001, regarding the international terrorist threat to the United States. I caution that the inquiry remains a work in progress, and that we may be developing additional relevant information as our work continues. That being said, we feel it is important to share with the American people, through these hearings, what we have found through our efforts to date. Let me briefly describe the way in which we have approached this review. We decided to target our search on categories of information that would most likely yield any intelligence material of relevance to the September 11th attacks. Specifically, our teams requested and reviewed from the intelligence community agencies these categories of information: any information obtained before September 11th suggesting that an attack on the United States was imminent and what was done with it; any information obtained before September 11th that should have alerted the intelligence community to this kind of attack, that is, using airplanes to attack buildings, and what was done with it; any information obtained before September 11th about the 19 dead hijackers and what was done with it; and any information obtained after September 11th about the hijackers and their backgrounds, including their involvement with al Qaeda, entry into this country, and activities while in this country, as well as why they never came to the attention of the United States government. And I would point out on the issue of the hijackers that we do intend -- we will not address that this morning, but we do intend to have an additional statement at subsequent hearings that are focused on that issue. As part of its review of the evolution of the international terrorist threat against the United States, the joint inquiry staff produced a chronology that began in 1982 and ends on September 11th, 2001, and that chronology, I believe, has been reproduced and handed out, and is also depicted on these charts here in the room this morning. And I would request that the chronology also be made part of the record. SEN. GRAHAM: Without objection, so ordered. MS. HILL: The chronology notes significant events in international terrorism, significant counter-terrorist actions that were taken by the U.S. government in response to the threat, and information received by the intelligence community that was potentially relevant to the September 11th attacks. The chronology underscores several points regarding with the U.S. government, specifically the intelligence community, knew about the international terrorist threat to the United States and U.S. interests prior to September 11th, 2001, and these are those points. September 11th, while indelible in magnitude and in impact, was by no means America's first confrontation with international terrorism. While the nature of the threat has evolved and changed over time, it has long been recognized that United States interests were considered prime targets by various international terrorist groups. In response to a number of terrorist attacks on U.S. interests abroad during the 1980s, the U.S. government initiated a focused effort on terrorism -- against terrorism -- including the establishment by the director of central intelligence, William Casey, of the Counter-Terrorism Center, or CTC at CIA headquarters in 1986. In 1996, 10 years later, the FBI created its own counter-terrorism center at FBI headquarters. Both in terms of attempts and actual attacks, there was considerable historical evidence prior to September 11th that international terrorists had planned, and were in fact capable of conducting major terrorist strikes within the United States. The 1993 attack on the World Trade Center, the subsequent discovery in 1993 of plots to bomb New York City landmarks, and the arrest in 1999, during the millennium, of an individual with al Qaeda connections intending to bomb Los Angeles International Airport should have erased any doubts, to the extent they existed, about that point. From 1994 through as late as August 2001, the intelligence community had received information indicating that international terrorists had seriously considered the use of airplanes as a means of carrying out terrorist attacks. While this method of attack had clearly been discussed in terrorist circles, there was apparently little, if any effort, by intelligence community analysts to produce any strategic assessments of terrorists using aircraft as weapons. Osama Bin Laden's role in international terrorism came to the attention of the intelligence community in the early 1990s. While bin Laden was initially viewed as a financier of terrorism, by 1996, the intelligence community was aware of his involvement in directing terrorist acts and had begun actively collecting intelligence on him. Bin Laden's own words indicated a steadily escalating threat. In August 1996, Osama Bin Laden issued a public fatwah or religious decree authorizing attacks on Western military targets in the Arabian Peninsula. In February 1998, bin Laden issued another public fatwah authorizing and promoting attacks on U.S. civilians and military personnel anywhere in the world. Following the August 1998 bombings of two U.S. embassies in East Africa, intelligence community leadership recognized how dangerous bin Laden's network was. In December 1998, director of central intelligence, George Tenet, provided written guidance to his deputies at the CIA, declaring, in effect, a, quote, ""war"" with bin Laden. While counter-terrorism was a resource priority from the time of the DCI's statement onward, it was competing with several other intelligence priorities, such as non-proliferation. Despite the DCI's declaration of war in 1998, there was no massive shift in budget or reassignment of personnel to counter-terrorism until after September 11th, 2001. By late 1998, the intelligence community had amassed a growing body of information --though general in nature, and lacking specific details on time and on place -- indicating that bin Laden and the al Qaeda network intended to strike within the United States, and concern about bin Laden continued to grow over time and reached peak levels in the spring and summer of 2001, as the intelligence community faced increasing numbers of reports of imminent al Qaeda attacks against U.S. interests. In July and August 2001, that rise in intelligence reporting began to decrease, just as three additional developments occurred in the United States -- the Phoenix memo, the detention of Zacarias Moussaoui, and the intelligence community's realization that two individuals with ties to bin Laden's network, Khalid Al-Midhar and Nawaq Alhamzi, were possibly in the United States. The two individuals turned out to be two of the 19 hijackers on September 11th. The intelligence community apparently had not connected these individual warning flags to each other, to the drumbeat of threat reporting that had just occurred, or to the urgency of the war effort against bin Laden. Our review today provides further context for each of these points, and my written statement addresses in great detail each point. For purposes of this review, I am going to focus not on the historical sections but rather on our review of more recent intelligence reporting. And the first point in that regard would be intelligence reporting on bin Laden's intentions to strike inside the United States. Central to the September 11th plot was Osama Bin Laden's idea of carrying out a terrorist operation within the United States. It has been suggested that prior to September 11th, 2001, information available to the intelligence community had for the most part pointed to a terrorist threat against U.S. interests abroad. Our review confirmed that shortly after Osama Bin Laden's May 1998 press conference, the intelligence community began to acquire intelligence information indicating that bin Laden's network intended to strike within the United States. These intelligence reports, which I'll go through in a minute, should be understood in their proper context. First, they generally did not contain specific information as to where, when and how a terrorist attack might occur, and generally they are not corroborated by further information. Second, these reports represented a small percentage of the threat information that the intelligence community obtained during this period, most of which pointed to the possibility of attacks against U.S. interest overseas. Nonetheless, there was a modest but relatively steady stream of intelligence information indicating the possibility of terrorist attacks within the United States. Third, the credibility of the sources providing this information was sometimes questionable. While one could not as a result give too much credence to some individual reports, the totality of the information in the body of reporting clearly reiterated a consistent and critically important theme -- bin Laden's intent to launch terrorist attacks inside the United States. And I will summarize several of these reports -- and I should stress again, these are in declassified versions, they have been declassified. In June 1998, the intelligence community obtained information from several sources that bin Laden was considering attacks in the United States, including Washington, D.C. and New York. This information was provided to senior U.S. government officials in July 1998. In August 1998, the intelligence community obtained information that a group of unidentified Arabs planned to fly an explosive-laden plane from a foreign country into the World Trade Center. The information was passed to the FBI and the FAA. The FAA found the plot highly unlikely given the state of that foreign country's aviation program. Moreover, they believed that a flight originating outside the United States would be detected before it reached its intended target inside the United States. The FBI's New York office took no action on the information, filing the communication in the office's bombing repository file. The intelligence community has acquired additional information since then indicating there may be links between this group and other terrorist groups, including al Qaeda. In September 1998, the intelligence community prepared a memorandum detailing al Qaeda infrastructure in the United States, including the use of fronts for terrorist activities. This information was provided to senior U.S. government officials in September of 1998. In September of 1998, the intelligence community obtained information that bin Laden's next operation would possibly involve flying an aircraft loaded with explosives into a U.S. airport and detonating it. This information was provided to senior U.S. government officials in late 1998. In October 1998, the intelligence community obtained information that al Qaeda was trying to establish and operative cell within the United States. This information indicated there might be an effort underway to recruit U.S. citizen Islamists and U.S.-based expatriates from the Middle East and North Africa. In the fall of 1998, the intelligence community received information concerning a bin Laden plot involving aircraft in the New York and Washington, D.C. areas. In November 1998, the intelligence community obtained information that a bin Laden terrorist cell was attempting to recruit a group of five to seven young men from the United States to travel to the Middle East for training. This was in conjunction with planning to strike U.S. domestic targets. In November of 1998, the intelligence community received information that bin Laden and senior associates had agreed to allocate reward money for the assassinations of four top intelligence agency officers. The bounty for each assassination was $9 million. The bounty was in response to the U.S. announcement of an increase in the reward money for information leading to the arrest of bin Laden. In the spring of 1999, the intelligence community obtained information about a planned bin Laden attack on a U.S. government facility in Washington, D.C.. In August 1999, the intelligence community obtained information that bin Laden's organization had decided to target the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense and the Director of Central Intelligence. ""Target"" was interpreted by intelligence community analysts to mean assassinate. In September 1999 the intelligence community obtained information that bin Laden and others were planning a terrorist act in the United States, possibly against specific landmarks in California and New York City. The reliability of the source of this information was unknown. In late 1999 the intelligence community obtained information regarding the bin Laden network's possible plans to attack targets in Washington, DC and New York City during the New York's millennium celebration. On December 14th, 1999 an individual named Ahmed Ressam was arrested as he attempted to enter the United States from Canada. An alert U.S. Customs Service officer in Fort Washington stopped Ressam and asked to search his vehicle. Chemicals and detonator materials were found in his car. Ressam's intended target was Los Angeles International Airport. In February 2000 the intelligence community obtained information that bin Laden was making plans to assassinate U.S. intelligence officials, including the director of the FBI. In March 2000 the intelligence community obtained information regarding the types of targets that operatives in bin Laden's network might strike. The Statue of Liberty was specifically mentioned, as were skyscrapers, ports, airports, and nuclear power plants. In March 2000 the intelligence community obtained information indicating bin Laden was planning attacks in specific West Coast areas, possibly involving the assassination of several public officials. The intelligence community had concerns that this information might have come from a source known to fabricate information. And in April 20001 the intelligence community obtained information from a source with terrorist connections, who speculated that bin Laden would be interested in commercial pilots as potential terrorists. The source warned that the United States should not focus only on embassy bombings, that terrorists sought, quote, ""spectacular and traumatic,"" closed quotes, attacks and that the first World Trade Center bombing would be the type of attack that would be appealing. The source did not mention a timeframe for any attack. Because the source was offering personal speculation and not hard information, the information was not disseminated within the intelligence community. Bin Laden's declaration of war in 1998 and intelligence reports indicating possible terrorist plots inside the United States did not go unnoticed by the intelligence community, which, in turn, advised senior officials in the U.S. government of the serious nature of the threat. The staff has also reviewed documents other than individual intelligence reports that demonstrate that at least at senior levels the intelligence community understood that bin Laden posed a serious threat to the domestic United States. Here are five examples: A December 1st, 1998 intelligence community assessment of Osama bin Laden read in part, and I quote, ""UBL is actively planning against U.S. targets. Multiple reports indicate UBL is keenly interested in striking the U.S. on its own soil. Al-Qaeda is recruiting operatives for attacks in the U.S. but has not yet identified potential targets."" On December 4th, 1998 in a memorandum to his deputies at the CIA the director of Central Intelligence summed up the situation in this way, quote, ""We must now enter a new phased in our effort against bin Laden. Our work to date has been remarkable and in some instances heroic, yet each day we all acknowledge that retaliation is inevitable and that its scope may be far larger than we have previously experienced. We are at war. I want no resources or people spared in this effort either inside CIA or the community."" A classified document signed by a senior U.S. government official in December 1998 read in part, quote, ""The intelligence community has strong indications that bin Laden intends to conduct or sponsor attacks inside the United States."" In June 1999 testimony before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and in a July 1999 briefing to House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence staffers the chief of the CTC described reports that bin Laden and his associates were planning attacks in the United States. And a classified document signed by a senior U.S. government official in July 1999 characterized bin Laden's February 1998 statement as, quote, ""a de facto declaration of war,"" close quotes, on the United States. What is left clear is the extent to which other parts of the government, as well as the American people, understood and fully appreciated the gravity and the immediacy of the threat. For example, officials at the National Security Agency, whom we have interviewed, were aware of DCI Tenet's December 1998 declaration that the intelligence community was at war with bin Laden. On the other hand, relatively few of the FBI agents interviewed by the Joint Inquiry Staff seem to have been aware of DCI Tenet's declaration. There was also considerable variation in the degree to which FBI- led Joint Terrorism Task Forces or JTTF prioritized and coordinated field efforts targeting bin Laden and al-Qaeda. While the FBI's New York office was the lead office in the vast majority of counter- terrorism investigations concerning bin Laden, many other FBI offices around the country were unaware of the magnitude of the threat. There are also indications that the allocation of intelligence community resources after the DCI's December 1998 declaration did not adequately reflect a true war effort against bin Laden. In 1999 the CTC had only three analysts assigned full time to bin Laden's terrorist network worldwide. After 2000 but before September 11th, 2001, that number had risen to five. On a broader scale, our review has found little evidence prior to September 11th of a sustained national effort to mobilize public awareness and to harden the homeland against a potential assault by bin Laden within the United States, with the possible exception of a heightened focus on weapons of mass destruction. The second point that I want to cover is strategic warnings, indications of a possible terrorist attack in the spring and summer of 2001. Let me briefly describe what we have found regarding the level and the nature of threat information that was obtained by the intelligence community during the spring and summer of 2001. During that time period the community experienced a significant rise in information indicating that bin Laden and al-Qaeda intended to strike against United States interests in the very near future. Some individuals within the community have suggested that the increase in threat reporting was unprecedented, at least in terms of their own experience. While the reporting repeatedly predicted dire consequences for Americans, it did not provide actionable detail on when, where and how specific attacks would occur. Between late March and September 2001 the intelligence community detected numerous indicators of an impending terrorist attack, some of which pointed specifically to the United States as a possible target. In March 2001 an intelligence source claimed a group of bin Laden operatives were planning to conduct an unspecified attack in the United States in April 2001. One of the operatives allegedly resided within the United States. In April 2001 the intelligence community obtained information that unspecified terrorist operatives in California and New York State were planning a terrorist attack in those states for April. Between May and July the National Security Agency reported at least 33 communications indicating a possible imminent terrorist attack. None of these reports provided any specific information on where, when or how an attack might occur, nor was it clear that any of the individuals involved in these intercepted communications had any firsthand knowledge of where, when or how an attack might occur. If they did know, it was not evident in the intercept. These reports were widely disseminated within the intelligence community. In May 2001 the intelligence community obtained information that supporters of bin Laden were reportedly planning to infiltrate the United States via Canada in order to carryout a terrorist operation using high explosives. The report mentioned an attack within the United States though it did not say where in the U.S. or when or how an attack might occur. In July 2001 this information was shared with the FBI, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the U.S. Customs Service and the State Department and was included in a closely held intelligence report for senior government officials in August 2001. In May 2001 the Department of Defense acquired and shared with other elements of the intelligence community information indicating that seven individuals associated with bin Laden had departed various locations for Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States. In June 2001 the DCI's CTC had information that key operatives in Osama bin Laden's organization were disappearing while others were preparing for martyrdom. In July 2001 the DCI's CTC was aware of an individual who had recently been in Afghanistan, who had reported, quote, ""everyone is talking about an impending attack,"" close quotes. The intelligence community was also aware that bin Laden had stepped up his propaganda efforts in the preceding months. On August 16th, 2001, in Minneapolis, Minnesota the INS detained Zacarias Moussaoui. Prior to that date, in August 2001 Mr. Moussaoui's conduct had aroused suspicions about why he was learning to fly large commercial aircraft and had prompted the flight school he was attending in Minneapolis to contact the local FBI office. FBI agents believed that Moussaoui may have been intending to carry out a terrorist act. On August 23rd, 2001, the intelligence community requested that two individuals, Khalid al-Midhar and Nawaf Alhazmi, who had first come to the attention of the community in 1999 as possible associates of bin Laden's terrorist network, be added to the U.S. Department of State's watch list for denying visas to individuals attempting to enter the United States. Working levels of INS and U.S. Customs had determined that at least one of them was likely in the United States, prompting FBI headquarters to request searches for them in both New York and Los Angeles. The FBI's New York field office unsuccessfully searched for al- Midhar and Alhazmi. The FBI's Los Angeles office received the search request on September 11th, 2001. In late summer 2001 the intelligence community obtained information that an individual associated with al-Qaeda was considering mounting terrorist operations within the United States. There was no information available as to the timing of possible attacks or the alleged targets. And on September 10th, 2001 the NSA intercepted two communications between individuals abroad suggesting imminent terrorist activity. These communications were not translated into English and disseminated until September 12th, 2001. These intercepts did not provide any indication of where or what activities might occur. Despite these indicators of a possible terrorist attack inside the United States, during the course of interviews the joint inquiry staff was told that it was the general view of the U.S. intelligence community in the spring and summer of 2001 that an attack on U.S. interests was more likely to occur overseas. Individuals in the intelligence community pointed to intelligence information, the arrest of suspected terrorists in the Middle East and Europe, and a credible report of a plan to attack a U.S. Embassy in the Middle East as factors that shaped their thinking about where an attack was likely to occur. One senior FBI official said that based on the intelligence he was seeing, he thought there was a high probability, quote, ""98 percent,"" close quote, that the attack would occur overseas. During the summer of 2001, the intelligence community was also disseminating information through appropriate channels to senior U.S. government officials about possible terrorist attacks. For example, in June 2001, the community issued a terrorist threat advisory, warning U.S. government agencies that there was a high probability of an imminent terrorist attack against U.S. interests by Sunni extremists associated with bin Laden's al Qaeda organization. The advisory mentioned the Arabian peninsula, Israel and Italy as possible locations. According to the advisory, the community continued to believe that Sunni extremists associated with al Qaeda are most likely to attempt spectacular attacks, resulting in numerous casualties. Subsequently, intelligence information provided to senior government leaders indicated that bin Laden's organization expected near-term attacks to have dramatic consequences on government or cause major casualties. A briefing prepared for senior government officials at the beginning of July 2001 contained the following language, quote: ""Based on a review of all source reporting over the last five months, we believe that UBL will launch a significant terrorist attack against U.S. and/or Israeli interests in the coming weeks. The attack will be spectacular and designed to inflict mass casualties against U.S. facilities or interests. Attack preparations have been made. Attack will occur with little or no warning."" Later, intelligence information provided to senior government leaders indicated that bin Laden's organization continued to expect imminent attacks on U.S. interests. The joint inquiry staff has been advised by a representative of the intelligence community that about a month later, in August 2001, a closely-held intelligence report, for senior government officials, included information that bin Laden had wanted to conduct attacks in the United States since 1997. The information included discussion of the arrest of Ahmed Ressam in December 1999, and the 1998 bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. It mentioned that members of al Qaeda, including some U.S. citizens, had resided or traveled in or traveled to the United States for years, and that the group apparently maintained a support structure here. The report cited uncorroborated information obtained in 1998 that bin Laden wanted to hijack airplanes to gain the release of U.S.-held extremists. FBI judgments about patterns of activity, consistent with preparation of hijackings or other types of attacks, and the number of bin Laden number of investigations underway, as well as information acquired in May 2001 that indicated a group of bin Laden's supporters was planning attacks in the United States with explosives. In August 2001, based on information it had in its possession at the time, the CIA sent a message to the FAA, asking the FAA to advise corporate security directors of U.S. air carriers of the following information: Quote, ""A group of six Pakistanis currently based in Bolivia may be planning to conduct a hijacking, or possibly a bombing, or an act of sabotage against at commercial airliner. While we have no details of the carrier, the date or the location of this, or these possibly actions, we have learned the group has had discussions in which Canada, England, Malaysia, Cuba, South Africa, Mexico, Atlanta, New York, Madrid, Moscow and Dubai have come up, and India and Islamabad have been described as possible travel destinations,"" close quote. While this information was not related to an attack planned by al Qaeda, it did alert the aviation community to the possibility that a hijacking plot might occur in the U.S. shortly before the September 11th attacks occurred. Now I want to turn to intelligence information on possible terrorist use of airplanes as weapons. Central to the September 11th attack was the terrorist use of airplanes as weapons. In the aftermath of the attacks, there was much discussion about the extent to which our government was or could have been aware of the threat of terrorist attacks of this type, and the extent to which adequate precautions were taken to address the threat. Based on our review to date, we believe that the intelligence community was aware of the potential for this type of terrorist attack, but did not produce any specific assessments of the likelihood that terrorists would use airplanes as weapons. Our review has uncovered several examples of intelligence reporting on the possible use of airplanes as weapons in terrorist operations. In December 1994, Algerian Armed Islamic Group terrorists hijacked an Air France flight in Algiers, and threatened to crash it into the Eiffel Tower. French authorities deceived the terrorists into thinking the plane did not have enough fuel to reach Paris, and diverted it. A French anti-terrorist force stormed the plane and killed all four terrorists. In January 1995, a Philippine national police raid turned up materials in a Manila apartment indicating that three individuals planned, among other things, to crash a plane into CIA headquarters. The Philippine national police said that the same group was responsible for the bombing of a Philippine airliner on December 12th, 1994. Information on the threat was passed to the FAA, which briefed U.S. and major foreign carriers. In January 1996, the intelligence community obtained information concerning a planned suicide attack by individuals associated with Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman, and a key al Qaeda operative. The plan was to fly to the United States from Afghanistan, and attack the White House. In October 1996, the intelligence community obtained information regarding an Iranian plot to hijack a Japanese plane over Israel and crash it into Tel Aviv. An individual would board the plane in the Far East. During the flight he would commandeer the aircraft, order it to fly over Tel Aviv, and then crash the plane into the city. In 1997, one of the units at FBI headquarters became concerned about the possibility of a terrorist group using an unmanned aerial vehicle, UAV, for terrorist attack. The FBI and CIA became aware of reporting that this group had purchased a UAV. At the time the agency's view was that the only reason that this group would need a UAV would be for either reconnaissance or attack. There was more concern about the possibility of an attack outside the United States; for example, by flying the UAV into a U.S. Embassy or a visiting U.S. delegation. As noted previously, in August 1998, the intelligence community obtained information that a group of unidentified Arab planned to fly an explosive-laden plane from a foreign country into the World Trade Center. Also noted previously, in September '98, the intelligence community obtained information that bin Laden's next operation could possibly involve flying an aircraft loaded with explosives into a U.S. airport and detonating it. In November 1998, the community obtained information that a Turkish Islamic extremist group had planned a suicide attack to coincide with celebrations marking the death of Ataturk. The conspirators, who were arrested, planned to crash an airplane packed with explosives into Ataturk's tomb during a government ceremony. The Turkish press said the group had cooperated with Osama bin Laden. The FBI's New York office included this incident in one of its Osama bin Laden databases. In February 1999, the intelligence community obtained information that Iraq had formed a suicide pilot unit it planned to use against British and U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf. The CIA commented that this was highly unlikely, and probably disinformation. In March 1999, the intelligence community obtained information regarding a plan by an al Qaeda member who was a U.S. citizen to fly a hang glider into the Egyptian presidential palace, and then detonate the explosives he was carrying. The individual who received hang glider training in the United States brought the hang glider back to Afghanistan. In April 2000, the intelligence community obtained information regarding an alleged bin Laden plot to hijack a 747. The source, who was a walk-in to the FBI's Newark office, claimed that he had been to a training camp in Pakistan, where he learned hijacking techniques and received arms training. He also stated that he was supposed to meet five to six other individuals in the United States who would also participate in the plot. They were instructed to use all necessary force to take over the plane, because there would be pilots among the hijacking team. The plan was to fly the plane to Afghanistan, and if they could not make it there that they were to blow up the plane. Although the individual passed an FBI polygraph, the FBI was never able to verify any aspect of his story or identify his contacts in the United States. And, in August 2001, the intelligence community obtained information regarding a plot to either bomb the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi from an airplane, or crash an airplane into it. The intelligence community learned that two people who were reportedly acting on instructions from bin Laden met in October 2000 to discuss this plot. Despite these reports, the community did not produce any specific assessments of the likelihood that terrorists would use airplanes as weapons. This may have been driven in part by resource issues in the area of intelligence analysis. Prior to September 11th, 2001, the CTC had 40 analysts to analyze terrorism issues worldwide, with only one of the five branches focused on terrorist tactics. Prior to September 11th, 2001, the only terrorist tactic on which the CTC performed strategic analysis was the possible use of chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear weapons, because there were more obvious potential for mass casualties. At the FBI prior to September 11th, 2001, support for ongoing investigations and operations was favored in terms of resources over long-term strategic analysis. We were told during the course of our FBI interviews that prevention occurred in the operational unit, not through strategic analysis, and that prior to September 11th the FBI had insufficient resources to do both. We were also told that the FBI's al Qaeda related analytic expertise had been, quote, ""gutted,"" close quote, by transfers to operational units, and that as a result the FBI's analytic unit had only one individual working on al Qaeda at the time of the September 11 attacks. While focused strategic analysis was lacking, the subject of aviation related terrorism was included in some broader terrorist threat assessments, such as the National Intelligence Estimate on Terrorism. For example, the 1995 NIE on terrorism cited the consideration the Bojinka conspirators gave to attacking CIA headquarters with an aircraft. The document contained the following language: ""Our review of the evidence suggests that the conspirators were guided in the selection of the method and venue of the attack by carefully studying security procedures in place in the region. If terrorists operating in this country, the United States, are similarly methodical, they will identify serious vulnerabilities in the security system for domestic flights."" The 1997 update to that report on terrorism included the following language: ""Civil aviation remains a particularly attractive target, in light of the fear and publicity the downing of an airliner would evoke, and the revelations last summer of the U.S. air transport sector's vulnerabilities. In a December 2000 report, the FBI and the FAA published a classified assessment that suggested less concern about the threat to domestic aviation. Quote, ""FBI investigations confirm domestic and international terrorist groups operating within the United States, but do not suggest evidence of plans to target domestic civil aviation. Terrorist activity within the U.S. has focused primarily on fundraising, recruiting new members, and disseminating propaganda. While international terrorists have conducted attacks on U.S. soil, these acts represent anomalies in their traditional targeting, which focused on U.S. interests overseas."" After September 11th, 2001, the CIA belatedly acknowledged some of the information that was available and has been available regarding the use of airplanes as weapons. A draft analysis dated November 19th, 2001, entitled, ""The September 11th Attack: A Preliminary Assessment,"" states, ""We do not know the process by which bin Laden and his lieutenants decided to hijack planes with the idea of flying them into buildings in the United States. But the idea of hijacking planes for suicide attacks had long been current in jihadist circles. For example, GIA terrorists from Algeria had planned to crash an Air France jet into the Eiffel Tower in December 1994. And Ramzi Yousef, a participant in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, planned to explode 12 U.S. jet airliners, jetliners, in midair over the Pacific in the mid 1990s. Likewise, the World Trade Center had long been a target of terrorist bombers."" Despite the intelligence available in recent years, our review to date has found no indication that prior to September 11th, analysts from the intelligence community were cataloguing information regarding the use of airplanes as weapons as a terrorist tactic, sending requirements to collectors to look for additional information on this threat, or considering the likelihood that Osama bin Laden, al Qaeda or any other terrorist group would attack the United States or U.S. interests in these ways -- in this way. Mr. Chairman, our purpose this morning was to report on the information that the intelligence community possessed prior to September 11th, 2001 about terrorist attacks of the kind America witnessed on that fateful day. In closing, let me just say that for all of us who have been conducting this review, the task has been and continues to be not only a daunting one but, in all respects, a sobering one. We are ever mindful that lost lives and shattered families were the catalyst for this inquiry. We know, as I have heard Ms. Pelosi say many times, that we are on sacred ground. We also have come to know, from our review of the intelligence reporting, the depth and the intensity of the enemy's hatred for this country and the relentless zeal with which it targeted American lives. We understand not only the importance but also the enormity of the task facing the intelligence community. As my statement this morning suggests, the community made mistakes prior to September 11th, and the problems that led to those mistakes need to be addressed and they need to be fixed. On the other hand, the vengeance and the inhumanity that we saw on that day were not mistakes for Osama bin Laden and for others like him. The responsibility for September 11th remains squarely on the shoulders of the terrorists who planned and participated in the attacks. Their fervor and their cruelty may be incomprehensible, but it is real. It persists, and it is directed at Americans. We are convinced that it is no longer a question of whether the intelligence community can do better. It must do better. America can afford no less. Mr. Chairman, that concludes my statement this morning. Thank you. SEN. GRAHAM: Ms. Hill, I would like to extend my congratulations to you and the staff for an excellent, sobering assessment of the events prior to September the 11th. I recognize this is the first of what will be a series of publicly-released statements of the results of our inquiry to date, and we look forward to your future reports. MS. HILL: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. SEN. GRAHAM: We will now proceed to questions and comments from members, starting with Senator DeWine. Let me just state who the next questioners will be: Mr. Boehlert, Senator Wyden, Mr. Bereuter, Mr. Bishop, Senator Levin, Senator Inhofe, Mr. Peterson, Mr. Cramer. SEN. MIKE DEWINE (R-OH): Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. Ms. Hill, thank you for your very good statement and your good work. MS. HILL: Thank you, Senator. SEN. DEWINE: Mr. Chairman, thank you for the opportunity to make some brief remarks at this very important public hearing. Let me also thank our witnesses who testified this morning. While none of us can really understand what we've been through, I have seen how tragic the events of September 11th have been for my own state director, a very good friend of mine, Barbara Skenk (sp). Barbara lost her husband, Doug Cherry (sp), to the terrorist attacks. Before talking about what I hope comes out of these hearings, let me express a concern. I've been concerned from the outset of this investigation that the timed deadlines under which this committee is operating would not be conducive to producing the product that we want. The artificial deadline, I believe, is making it extremely difficult to get the job done. It's simply a lack of time. It's a lack of resources. However, Mr. Chairman, there still are things that we can accomplish, even with the current constraints of this investigation. First, it is important to report -- and we've begun this today -- it's important to report to the American people what intelligence failures did occur, not so we can assess blame but so we can learn from the specific mistakes that were made. But there is more to it than that. Yes, we need to gather the facts and take time to examine what they mean with regard to what happened on September 11th. But we certainly cannot stop there. We also need to figure out what these facts tell us about the current structure of our overall intelligence community. What are the shortcomings? Where do we need reform? Now, I felt Mr. Push's testimony earlier was very excellent. I thought he talked about some of the big-picture issues that we're not going to resolve on this committee, but at least we can begin to look at and begin that national dialogue about these issues. So I thought his testimony was particularly telling. I think, for example, Mr. Chairman, in investigating these issues, we must take a serious look at the role of the director of Central Intelligence. I believe it's time to give the DCI the necessary authority and ability to truly direct our overall intelligence operations. Quite simply, we need to empower the DCI to do the job. I believe we also must seriously examine the long-term resource issues that confront us, not just now but over the long haul, over the next decade or two decades. Do we have the human resources available within the agencies themselves? Do we have the right technology and enough of it to get the job done in the new world that we live in? Do we have a long-term commitment to intelligence? I think we need to discuss that commitment and what we are looking at and make it very plain to the American people the sacrifices that are going to have to be made if that intelligence community is to do its job and what kind of resources they need. And finally, I believe that we need to re-examine the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act with the FISA statute and determine what changes are needed to make sure we are getting the intelligence resources to help prevent future attacks. FISA deserves and requires a great deal of attention and oversight from the joint committee, from the Senate and House Intelligence Committees, and frankly from the entire Congress. We must focus our congressional duty for oversight, as we simply have not had, in my opinion, effective oversight since FISA was instituted approximately a quarter of a century ago. Somehow we've got to figure out, Mr. Chairman, how to do that. Finally, this committee's job, I believe, is really to kick off, to launch, a serious national debate about what changes must be made in our intelligence community, because if we've learned anything from September 11th, it is that our security, our safety, the safety of our loved ones, is intrinsically linked to the quality of that intelligence. I thank the chair. SEN. GRAHAM: Thank you, Senator. Congressman Boehlert. REP. SHERWOOD BOEHLERT (R-NY): Mr. Chairman, let me ask a procedure. Are we just to have an opening statement or to go right to questions? SEN. GRAHAM: It is your choice. You have five minutes for either questions or discussion. REP. BOEHLERT: I thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Ms. Hill, let me thank you for an excellent presentation. Let me begin where you ended. You said, ""We are convinced that it is no longer a question of whether the intelligence community can do better. It must do better. America can afford no less."" I could not agree more with that statement. Your summation of our 10 closed hearings and the revelation of information in the public domain is somewhat difficult to deal with, because so much of what we've had, obviously, during those closed hearings has been highly classified, dealing with sensitive national- security information. But it appears to me that the alarm was sounded not once but several times, but too many gave it a deaf ear. I'm not ascribing any sinister motives. I'm just saying too many were not paying attention. There are a lot of reasons for that -- resource deficiencies, lack of adequate staff. Some of the revelations in your testimony are just absolutely mind-boggling. But let me ask something. Back in '98, when the director of Central Intelligence declared war on al Qaeda, sent a memorandum to his agency people. Was it a unilateral declaration of war? Was that memorandum shared with anyone but the in-house people at CIA? Did it go to the FBI? Did it go to all the other agencies in the intelligence community? MS. HILL: We have been following that question in the course of our interviews, and we've been basically -- we're dealing with a lot of the agencies in the intelligence community. We're trying to find out how much the entire community was aware of that declaration of war. And what we're finding is some people were, I think, close; certainly senior levels in the CIA were, and probably in the CIA. But as I mentioned, if you go out to the field offices of the FBI, they were not aware of it. Other people in the federal government were not aware of it. The Defense Department people -- we've interviewed some people there who were not aware of it who might have been interfacing with the community. So I would say it appears to be it was the DCI's decision. It was circulated to some people, but certainly not broadly within the community. And what I find disturbing about it is that it was at senior levels, but sometimes the operative level, the level in the field is where it actually is critical that they know what the priorities should be and have to be, particularly when it's something like combating something like al Qaeda. The field offices of the FBI, in terms of domestic activity, are crucial, because they are the ones who are going to be in the front lines in the United States dealing with those kinds of groups. And, at least in that respect, what we're finding is that many of them were not aware of that declaration of war, and some of them really were not focused very much at all on al Qaeda and bin Laden. REP. BOEHLERT: Well, I find that incomprehensible, quite frankly, because a key operative in our intelligence community, a leader, issued something as important as a declaration of war against an organization that has openly declared its determined effort, the fatwah, the religious decree, to destroy America and Americans. And that information is not shared at the highest level down to the lowest level, which brings me forward to the Phoenix memo and the Minneapolis case involving Mr. Moussaoui. And I've checked with counsel to see if it's all right to reveal some of this stuff, because the problem is I have difficulty, and I've had it for all the years I've served on the committee, in recalling where I learned the information I have. Was it from a highly secure, highly sensitive briefing, or did I read it in the front page of the newspaper? And so my practice has been to just not talk to the media at all about this very important assignment. Then we go forward to the Phoenix memo, which was sent up to headquarters, at a time we had a declaration of war in the intelligence community, and the memo was marked ""routine."" MS. HILL: Well, and it was not only at the time of the declaration of war; it was in the summer of 2001. It was at a time when the threat level was very high also. REP. BOEHLERT: And so the memo was marked ""routine,"" and it was given the most routine handling and never got above mid-level. And then we go out to Minneapolis and the Moussaoui case, and that was treated in a somewhat cavalier, very routine manner. I fail to see how, with all the alarms that were sounded -- well, we know there was not the proper coordination. There was not the proper information-sharing. You have indicated some corrective action has been taken -- oh, my God, we'd only hope so -- since September 11th. But I would suggest a lot of corrective action should have been taken well before September 11th. Let me ask you this. With our first two witnesses, Ms. Breitweiser and Mr. Push -- and their testimony was very poignant -- SEN. GRAHAM: Your time has expired. REP. BOEHLERT: That's a fast five minutes. Just let me finish the one question; I'm in the middle of it. SEN. GRAHAM: We'll be compassionate. REP. BOEHLERT: Did you spend an extended amount of time with both of these witnesses? Because they both have statements that are forever seared in our souls. Some deal with opinion. Others deal with alleged facts. And so did you spend a good amount of time with them? And have you checked up on the alleged facts that they presented? And I'm not questioning those facts; I just want to make sure we're dealing with the same information. MS. HILL: I have met with Ms. Breitweiser several times, since I joined this effort with the committee, with her and her group. And Mr. Push, I believe I've met with him once. I have not checked up on all the specifics in their statement because I didn't see their statements till -- we got those statements yesterday. But I've had a lot of discussions with them. And some of the things, you know, that they mentioned, I'm aware of. Some of them I'd want to look into in more detail, obviously. REP. BOEHLERT: Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your indulgence. SEN. GRAHAM: Thank you. Senator Wyden. SEN. RON WYDEN (R-OR): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ms. Hill, as you know, there were years of history indicating that airplanes would be used as a tool of terrorism. And yet you state on page 30 -- and I'll quote here -- ""Our review to date has found no indications that prior to September 11th analysts in the intelligence community were cataloguing information regarding the use of airplanes as weapons as a terrorist tactic, sending requirements to collectors to look for additional information on this threat, or considering the likelihood that bin Laden, al Qaeda or other terrorist groups would attack the United States or U.S. interests in this way."" That is a remarkable statement, given the history going back I believe to 1994 at least. And my question to begin with is when you ask the intelligence community why this was the case, why they didn't catalogue this information regarding the use of planes as weapons or consider the likelihood that they would be used as terrorist tools, what was the response of the intelligence community when you asked them why? MS. HILL: Well, I think a couple things. They would probably say to that question, and we've spoken to many people over there and gotten opinions and reactions on this, you have to understand the reason we have been able to catalogue all these instances is because one of the things we did was ask the community to go back and find anything that related to aircraft as weapons. So we went back and consolidated and went through their databases to pull it all out so you could see it all together. And I don't believe that had been done before we focused on it, given September 11th. So, one, it's not been all pulled together for them to see it other than piecemeal over time. Secondly, I think what they will tell you on almost many of these things in the terrorism field is that they were overwhelmed. The people who were looking at al-Qaeda and bin Laden will complain to you about resources, about the amount of information that was coming in. They were overwhelmed by almost a flood of information. Because as you can see from our statement there's a lot of reporting in there just on these topics. And, of course that reporting is but a small amount of the overall amount of reporting that the community deals with. So I think the reason they would give you that they had not done that was that it was spread out over time, they were overwhelmed by resources and other priorities and they were overwhelmed by the amount of information they were getting and dealing with the responses to other areas. SEN. WYDEN: What is so hard to swallow, however, is how anything could be a higher priority than this. And for you to state that the intelligence community was not considering the likelihood that bin Laden, al-Qaeda would attack the United States in this way is, of course exactly the kind of thing we've got to address in this inquiry. In your testimony and also from the victims' families we have heard about the failure to place Khalid al-Midhar and Nawaf Alhazmi -- and by the way Mr. Alhazmi is listed in the phone book in San Diego, I gather -- MS. HILL: I'm aware of that. SEN. WYDEN: -- on a watch list that would have prevented their entry into the United States. I offered an amendment on the intelligence bill this year to create a terrorist tracking system that would help ensure that this information would finally actually get shared to everybody in the intelligence area, everybody in the law enforcement area and would actually get to local law enforcement officials. In your view, to make this kind of system effective, what sort of policies need to be included so that finally we can respond to what Mr. Push has asked for, and that is to have a system that on an ongoing basis makes this a top priority, tracking the most dangerous individuals who threaten this country? MS. HILL: Well, I think part of it is you have to get people's attention. I mean, you have to get people focused on the need to do that, people in the system, in the agencies and in the groups that are working on those issues. I mean, in this case, and we're going to go into that particular case in much more detail when we present our testimony or our statement on the hijackers that would relate to the case you're talking about, so we will go into it in a lot more detail and tell you what we've heard from people who were handling that information at the time and why it slipped by them. But I think part of what you will hear again was you may hear things, everything from they had too many things to do, it wasn't considered that significant, they were overwhelmed and it was simply a mistake, they made a mistake. SEN. WYDEN: Mr. Chairman, my time has expired. I would only want to add one last point with respect to where I think we are in terms of our inquiry. As we all know, there are many both on this committee and off who think that essentially this committee ought to punt to an independent effort. I'm of the view that the bar is very, very high now in terms of establishing the credibility of this effort and to show that we're capable of attacking these fundamental problems. This is not something that's going to be solved by just moving the boxes around on the organizational charts and people going up with pointers and saying the problem is solved. So I think Ms. Hill has helped us with the families to get off to a good start and I look forward to working with my colleagues. SEN. GRAHAM: Thank you very much, Senator. Mr. Bishop. REP. BISHOP: Thank you. This is indeed an historic occasion when the two intelligence committees are working together on a matter of great importance like this comes to pass. And I'm sure, however, that given the nature and the circumstances, which require our attention, the destructive attacks on our country September 11th, it's a task, which all of us wish that we didn't have to face. But we're most appreciative today for the well-prepared, thoughtful and helpful testimony presented by Ms. Breitweiser and Mr. Push. We have a responsibility to thoroughly and professionally gather, assess and present the facts about September 11th as they relate to the performance of the intelligence agencies. And as we enter these public hearings there remains a general sense of disappointment and disbelief within the American people that those agencies, particularly the CIA and the FBI, were not better positioned to detect the conspiracy and to prevent the attacks. We must try to address the many questions, which have arisen about why better intelligence was not collected, why better use was not made of the information, which was available, and now publicly examining the performance of the community and the decisions that were made in the Executive Branch and perhaps in Congress about the establishment of priorities within the intelligence community. We will be conducting the type of oversight, which these committees are at present uniquely situated to provide. It is my continued hope that these hearings and our final report will result in a marked improvement in our understanding of the events that led up to 9/11 and most importantly in our ability to protect the American people from terrorist attacks such as these. I look forward to working with the joint leadership and all of our scheduled witnesses, and I want to thank Ms. Hill and her staff for the tremendous work that they have done under very, very difficult circumstances with some muzzling and bridling and limitations and with great time constraints. It has, I think, been a valiant effort and we will certainly as a committee work with you to try to secure the cooperation that you need from the Executive Branch and the agencies in getting access and being able to explain to the American people and have this committee explain to the American people in the kind of detail, which does not compromise forces and methods, plans and intentions or active or ongoing prosecutions so that they can understand as well as we hope to understand what happened, why it happened and what we can do to make sure it does not happen again. With that, I have no questions, but I did want to share those comments and thank again the witnesses for taking the time and the effort, which must have been extremely difficult, given the exigencies of your lives over the past year to have come forward and done the magnificent job that you did today. SEN. GRAHAM: Thank you, Mr. Bishop. Our next questioner or discussant will be Senator Levin. After Senator Levin, Mr. Boswell, Mr. Castle, Mr. Roemer, Ms. Harman, Mr. Burr, Senator Bayh and Senator Rockefeller. Senator Levin. SEN. LEVIN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and first let me thank you, Ms. Hill and your staff for getting us to the point where we are finally analyzing and presenting to the American people the significant intelligence failures, which occurred prior to September 11th. At this stage of the inquiry much is already evident. First, the intelligence community said that it was at war with Osama bin Laden and had said so for three years prior to the attack of September 11th. Second, despite National Security Advisor Condaleeza Rice's assertions to the contrary, the use of a plane as a terrorist weapon, capable of causing mass casualties, was neither ingenuous nor novel but rather a method of attack that the intelligence community knew that the terrorists were considering as early as the early to mid 90s. Third, there is much troubling evidence that information crucial to preventing attacks by al-Qaeda terrorists was not shared or acted upon by intelligence officials prior to September 11th. Those intelligence failures will haunt loved ones and their families and should also haunt us and motivate us to very strong and necessary reforms. Here are just a few examples that I'm summarizing from your report: In January of 2000 the U.S. intelligence community was alerted to a meeting of al-Qaeda members in Malaysia, including two of the eventual hijackers of America Airlines Flight 77. The handoff of that information from the CIA to the FBI was bungled. The individuals were not tracked and inexplicably were not promptly placed on a watch list. Ten days later the two accomplices entered the United States on a flight to Los Angeles. The location of the individuals after they were finally placed on the watch list was also mishandled. Second, a July 10, 2001 memorandum from an FBI field agent in Phoenix to the Osama bin Laden unit and the radical fundamentalist unit at FBI headquarters, requesting that an investigation be opened into foreign terrorist training at flight schools in the U.S. was never acted upon, nor was the Phoenix field investigation shared with the CIA as specifically suggested by the FBI agent. And this is not in your memo, but this is what we learned, that nearly a year after the Phoenix memo the FBI director was unable to explain to our committee who saw that request from the Phoenix FBI agent, what was done with the request and who, if anyone, had been held accountable for letting that important information fall between some crack. Third, the August 16th, 2001 arrest of Zacarias Moussaoui and the suspicions of the FBI agents in Minneapolis that he might be planning to undertake a terrorist attack using a plane, and the urgent request that a warrant to search his computer and other belongings were not acted upon by FBI headquarters And I want to emphasize a point here. These were not some reports from unreliable sources. These were not unconfirmed statements. These were FBI agents that were asking for action. Their requests were ignored. Now, I believe it is critically important for the administration to release the Phoenix memorandum, documents relating to the Minneapolis FBI office request and other documents that will allow the American people to judge for themselves the significance of these missed signals and the failures to share information between and within the intelligence and law enforcement communities. The committee, I understand, has asked for declassification of those documents. That request is under consideration, I understand, by the administration in preparation for next week's hearings. And I -- we've had discussion about this already this morning, but I do hope that the leadership of these committees, our committees, will let the administration know that our committees will seek congressional authorization, by legislation if necessary, to declassify appropriate information if the executive branch refuses. We have chairmen and vice chairmen of our committees who have agreed on some matters. It seems to me that is enough for us as committees to automatically authorize them to seek legislation should the executive branch refuse. And that would go to future refusals, not just to previous ones. The American people understand that perfection is unattainable, but they also believe, as I do, that when errors are made, accountability -- accountability is essential if lessons are to be learned for the sake of the future security of our nation. Now, is my time up? SEN. GRAHAM: Thank you, Senator, for those very thoughtful -- (applause) -- and obviously well-received suggestions of actions by the committee. We will take those under advisement. Mr. Boswell. REP. LEONARD BOSWELL (D-IA): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think the word that's hit me hardest today has been the word ""sobering."" And as I heard the testimony of Kristen and Stephen, it caused me to have a little flashback in my earlier life when I had to spend a lonely night, as some of the rest of you have done, to write to the loved ones where their loved one was lost in the battlefield that day. I've sensed your pain. I love you, respect you, and want you to have relief. And I see the relief for you is to see that these lessons learned are learned and followed and not have to be learned again. I used to work for Admiral Flecky (sp), the -- probably the most decorated living American -- you put that in your lessons learned file and don't have to learn it again, and that's what I hope we accomplish here. I feel like that maybe my colleague from the Senate that said that maybe we don't need this extra (blue ribbon ?) panel after listening to Kristen and Stephen. I think he made a pretty good case, maybe we do need it. And I wonder about the time, and the resource, and availability to us to finish this job. Well, I trust that in the days lying ahead of you, Mr. Chairman, you're going to be dealing with this side of the operation and I know you'll give it serious consideration. A couple of questions, Ms. Hill, that I might ask, and I'll just ask them all, and then I can refresh if you need them, but I assume if -- do you intend to have further statements of fact as we go forward from here today? MS. HILL: Not today, but we do in the future hearings, right. REP. BOSWELL: I mean in the future -- all right. Would you want to elaborate a little bit on what -- or could you -- what agencies had responsibility to respond to the warnings? We've heard so much about the warnings for two, three years. Would you have any comment from your research and your study that -- who should have been responding? Military? Who? MS. HILL: Well, it would depend on what -- you mean a warning from the intelligence community or the reports? I mean -- REP. BOSWELL: Or a combination -- did we fail as part of our lesson learned, if we can, an area of -- maybe there should have been some responses going out to somebody else? MS. HILL: Well, some of the -- I mean, some of this information was disseminated further, some was not disseminated. Some, for instance, we talked about some went to the FAA in certain cases, and then they in turn would put out a warning. For instance, I talked about the one of terrorist attack to commercial, private industry. REP. BOSWELL: Okay. MS. HILL: So, it depends on the nature of what the threat was and who they would warn. But -- REP. BOSWELL: I think in your further analysis that may be what I'm asking, is that you share with us as you look at it and have more time, if there are some things that we could put in this -- MS. HILL: We are -- I can say that we are pursuing the whole issue of -- I mean, there's questions, warnings and dissemination of information, is not just sharing information, as Senator Levin was talking about, within the intelligence community, between the FBI and CIA for example, but also sharing threat information beyond the intelligence community to the agencies within government, outside the community, and also to the private sector, which gets into the warning and how far this information went. And that is an area we're looking at, and we haven't yet, you know, come back with a report on it, but we are looking at that. And -- and, you know, that's a valid point, because the intelligence -- not only is the job to get the good intelligence and to analyze it, but then to disseminate it to people who can use it in a timely manner. So -- REP. BOSWELL: Okay, thank you. And I just -- I've got a little bit of time left -- do you have any comments about the, you know, all the emphasis on bin Laden and his activities and his lack of, prior to September 11th, that is, lack of ability to -- to bring damage to us -- did that lure people into complacency, even at the senior levels? MS. HILL: I think part of it is, as I alluded to earlier, is that the community, you know, does get so much information, and as I said in this statement, there were a lot of these threats coming in, but they -- a lot of them, they couldn't really corroborate. They didn't know if some of them were true or not true. So, I think, you know, it may be human nature if you keep hearing this stuff all the time and nothing happens and you never really know if it's accurate, you tend to start disregarding. And the -- the problem is that buried in the middle of all that where some may be accurate, some may be not, there may be something that really is important that needs to be looked at. So, it may be that when the threat level was very high and all the chatter was coming through, it was hard to distinguish what was really legitimate and something they needed to be concerned about. REP. BOSWELL: Thank you very much. My time is up. I appreciate the hard work that you've presented to us, the straightforwardness, and I'm looking forward to what you further have to say as we go on from here. MS. HILL: Thank you. SEN. GRAHAM: Thank you, Mr. Boswell. Mr. Castle. REP. MICHAEL CASTLE (R-DE): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would also like to thank Ms. Breitweiser and Mr. Push for their testimony on their own behalf and on behalf of the others who have endured this. You're brave to be here, but you also had a lot to say, and from a perspective that's different than we've heard so far. And I also thank Ms. Hill for making sure that we started off with this testimony, I think it's vitally important now that we hear this. And some of my -- these are sort of statements-slash-questions, let me go through a few of them, and if we have time, perhaps you could respond to some of them, Ms. Hill, based in large part on matters that both Kristen and Stephen reference. But what has concerned me for some time, and Mr. (Boehlert ?) referenced it too, and that is the whole business of -- of public verses private, or classified information verses non-classified information. I for one have felt for some time, having served on this committee for a while now, that we over-classify terribly in the world of intelligence. You read about it the next day in the New York Times, it's about 90 percent of what you had heard about the day before. And I just have serious questions about that. But the point was made in some of their testimony about the failure to warn the public -- and I would imagine the public really didn't know much about bin Laden. Based on what you said, I'm not even sure the intelligence community knew what it should have known about bin Laden when September 11th came in 2001. We saw what the president has been able to do with Saddam Hussein, who is probably on the forefront of the minds of almost every American today. We know what can be done if there is a greater public awareness of what is going on. And a lot that's happened since September 11th of last year has caused us all to be much more aware of possible terrorist activities or whatever. I would hope as our committee looks at all this we'd look at the public aspect of it. The American public is very intelligent and very cognizant of what's going on in the world, and if they're given a chance to know what the potential problems are, my sense is that perhaps we can prevent some of the problems that we've had so far, and we shouldn't be so closed as far as intelligence is concerned. Now, I understand there are circumstances in which that cannot happen. I well understand that and I'm not trying to go too far in saying that, but I really think we need to visit that question in terms of speeches being given by people in the intelligence community perhaps could be more open in terms of information that could be released, that kind of thing. And I'm very interested in pursuing that at some point. Something that Mr. Push said I had heard earlier when I had visited the homeland security, and that is that the officials here in Washington were struck by how much the local law enforcement officers know about what's happening in their communities, about individuals in their communities, perhaps troubled individuals in their communities, various things that we probably would never know in Washington, D.C. There are a whole lot of them, you know, well over half-a-million state and local law enforcement officers who have a tremendous world of knowledge. And I think that homeland security is looking at trying to develop and to cultivate that knowledge, and to make it part of a central -- not a central bank necessarily, but the ability to have that information go up and be digested and used in dealing with terrorists and other activities in this country. I think that's vitally important. We don't hear much about that. We hear about the CIA and the FBI and NSA and various major federal agencies. When you're dealing overseas, that's probably what it's all about. But when you're dealing in America, and also even when you are dealing overseas, you are dealing with some sort of a cell or a pod or somebody who is here locally. It is very helpful to have that information. And I hope as we go about our business of this particular committee and what we are doing that we incorporate that into it as well. So that also concerns me. And there's another area that is much broader too than anything we have talked about, and that's the area of prevention overall. I am vitally concerned about the hatred that exist in the Middle East apparently, at least in certain pockets of the Middle East, for America and perhaps for Israel and other portions of the world. And I don't know how to go about this. I am not suggesting that we should be starting to formulate policy with respect to diplomacy and education, but it seems to me it is something we should be paying attention to. If we could get to the root causes of this, of why that is there, if we could start to build the relationships that might change -- this might take 10, 15 or 25 years -- but I don't think we should ignore it. And perhaps it's a little bit beyond what we are doing on this committee. But the bottom line is I think it's a very important function of what we are doing as American citizens to try to prevent terrorist activities as far as the future is concerned. And I do have a specific question -- I'd like you to comment on any of those things -- and then a specific question and I think about 10 seconds here I think -- and that is just how far along are we in terms of all of your work. Are we going to be able to get our work done by the completion of this Congress? MS. HILL: I am optimistic that we will be able to get through what we have in our minds sat down and figured would be our schedule in terms of treating various topics that we think need to be treated. Where no one can ever be sure is that things are still coming up as we investigate. You know, once you start looking at an agency, and you are going through files, what tends to happen is the more you get into it the more you start finding more things. And as we find things, we want to follow those where the facts lead and make sure we understand what did or did not happen. And that takes time. So there are some things like that that we are now working on that are going to take us more time, because we haven't planned for that. But I am cautiously optimistic we can make what I think would be a significant contribution on this whole front in terms of really understanding what did and didn't happen here before the 11th, and why we didn't know more in terms of what were the systemic problems that were preventing people from knowing more. So I can't -- I would be foolish to sit here and tell you we are going to look at every single document on terrorism that the United States government had for the last 20 years, because we haven't tried to do that. We've tried to narrow it to where we get to the relevant material that pertains to September 11th. And that I think we have a good shot at doing. REP. CASTLE: Thank you, Ms. Hill. I'll take my other statements, and perhaps we can discuss them further at some point. I yield back, Mr. Chairman. SEN. GRAHAM: Thank you, Mr. Castle. Senator Rockefeller. SEN. ROCKEFELLER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Ms. Hill, very much for your distinguished work. In the interest of time, Mr. Chairman, I would like to make just three points. First, the fundamental question is what did the intelligence community know and then what did they do with what they knew? The work of the committee has not to this point unearthed any single piece of information, or smoking gun, if you will, that would have in and of itself prevented the attack. But we have found far too many breakdowns in the intelligence gathering and processing method. My own conclusion is that given the events and signals of the preceding decade, the intelligence community could have, and in my judgment should have, anticipated an attack on U.S. soil on the scale of 9/11. We had witnessed attacks on Americans overseas, as you laid out -- U.S.S. Cole, Kenya, Tanzania, Khobar, 1993 attack on the World Trade Center. We knew beyond any doubt that al Qaeda wanted to strike the United States. We were just sort of struck in our classic American innocence that anything that is going to happen is going to happen overseas. But there was information, and plenty of it, disseminated or not disseminated, that something was going to happen here. Yet the intelligence community for a whole host of reasons did not launch the all-out effort that is its responsibility, that might have detected and potentially prevented 9/11. Second, the FBI is an outstanding law enforcement agency, but I have serious questions about whether it is the right place to do intelligence work necessary in our country. Law enforcement is not necessarily compatible with intelligence gathering; in fact, it is not. It is not the same skills, not the same mission. Going forward we must not undermine the FBI's ability to carry out its fundamental responsibilities, because they are very important, and they do it very well. And we must not give short shrift to new intelligence demands. So we have to ask ourselves, Can the problem be addressed by reforming the FBI? I don't think so. Or is this a case where we need to find a wholly different solution? This is a tough question, obviously, which I hope this committee will be tackling in the coming months, and it leads me to my final point. Are we ready -- as a committee, as a Congress, as a government, as a people -- not only to pose the tough questions -- it's easy to do -- but also to find and to implement the tough solutions? It is clear to all of us that we must make serious changes in how we gather, process and react to intelligence in this country. Our existing agencies came into being in the Cold War -- that's fine. That structure no longer matches the threat that we face. Lines of authority are, in my judgment, blurred intentionally for the sake of turf, for the sake of all kinds of things which in some cases have justification and in many cases do not. The whole process leading up to today has been an interesting example of how difficult it is to get, you know at a very common purpose, to get people to agree on some relatively simple things. So lines of authority are blurred, information gets lost, and the mission is unfocused. The intelligence mission is unfocused. It might best be described as trying to do everything, and in the process doing little well. Far-reaching change isn't just a goal, it's a necessity. Unfortunately, it's a very controversial and very uncomfortable necessity. It's something they don't want to do here in Congress, they don't want to do at the White House, they don't want to do at the Defense Department, they don't want to do in the non-defense intelligence aspect of what we carry on in this country. But are we going to find the political will to create an intelligence system that works? Or are we going to say that this is going to be politically impractical or probably not doable, and therefore cut our goal by 50 percent, and then get leveraged down from there? So are we as a committee in which we have our own differences and our own conflicts -- as a Congress, where the same exists, and as a government where the same exists, and in the intelligence community where the same exists -- do we have the political will and the strength and the determination to do the job right? Nothing else counts. Thank you. SEN. GRAHAM: Thank you, senator. Mr. Roemer. REP. ROEMER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank Ms. Hill for an excellent presentation and outline this afternoon to help us understand this issue a bit more after several months of this investigation. I want to compliment your top-notch staff for their sacrifices and their hours of service to the country. And, Mr. Chairman, you and Mr. Goss on my side -- I want to compliment both of you for bringing together in a bipartisan way this committee to launch an unprecedented bicameral investigation into the worst terrorist attack in our nation's history. And it is with pride and confidence that I know we will produce a good product on this committee. In listening to the very moving testimony from Kristen and Steve this morning, I am even more convinced, I am even more compelled to work hard. I am even more persuaded that an independent blue-ribbon commission is the right way to go. It's the right way to go, because if this committee with its jurisdiction and its might and insight, and experience and dedication to intelligence, does its job, and by the very nature of an investigative inquiry staff doing their job over an eight-month period, unearthing facts, uncovering data, asking tough questions, they will produce even more questions for us to try to answer over the next year. So I think there is a compelling case by the very effectiveness of this committee to do its job near perfectly, and assume its jurisdiction as a body of Congress to take on this tough task, we make the case in a very convincing way for follow-up, and a thread attached to this for an independent blue ribbon commission to continue to look at these very, very tough questions, as to how to reorganize an intelligence community that made mistakes, that committed failures, that saw warnings, and reorganize it in a time when we are threatened by a brand-new source that wants to kill Americans in massive numbers very quickly. And they can do it in this kind of world environment. I think the case is made compellingly for an independent blue ribbon commission. And I think that complements us. And I think it adds into the history of this committee, the Intelligence Committee, which has had independent commission, as Aspin-Brown, Hart-Rudman, the NRO, Rumsfeld on ICBMs, and even in the Senate bill a brand-new commission to study something else. Ms. Hill, I do have a question or two that I wanted to ask about the classification of data. On page 16 there is a reference to information provided to senior U.S. government officials in September of 1998, and on page 28 mentioning senior government officials in July of 2001. Now, without getting into breaking our classification -- and we don't want to do that -- one would be a Democratic administration, one would be a Republican administration. Is there the possibility that those references might be, could be, to a White House? MS. HILL: Well, you know, obviously given the classification -- REP. ROEMER: I'm just asking in the realm of possibilities. MS. HILL: Well, I guess are you asking the term ""senior government officials"" couldn't -- I mean, I guess the term ""senior government officials"" would be anyone at a senior level in the entire U.S. government. So -- but I cannot -- as I understand the rules on this, we are not allowed -- REP. ROEMER: But your case, Ms. Hill, is that it is important for the American people to know when we get intelligence that it is not only intelligence agencies that act upon it, it's the administration, as to what they do with it, with the military, with other branches of government, the FAA -- MS. HILL: Right. REP. ROEMER: The Border Patrol and so forth and so on. MS. HILL: That's absolutely right, because to make intelligence really the way it should be, important and valuable, it has to be not only collected, analyzed, but it has to be disseminated to the people who can use it in a timely manner. That's the whole point of having intelligence. So -- REP. ROEMER: Part of our bipartisan efforts would be to get in a bipartisan way this access to declassifying that kind of reference. Is that your argument? MS. HILL: Well, I mean, our argument on this issue about the White House is that if you have declassified the information itself, it seems to us we don't see the national security interests in declassifying where it goes from there. If you declassify it it goes to some people, and you should be able to declassify, it goes to everybody, or whoever it went to to explain the -- REP. ROEMER: I would hope our committee would have a long, very serious discussion about what to do on the classification issue. Finally, Ms. Hill, if I could ask one final question, you mentioned the CTC and the number of analysts that they had, and I think mentioned a number of three to five. MS. HILL: Right. REP. ROEMER: Yet as we've looked at the CTC budget over the 1990s and a question of resources, without mentioning a specific number, which is classified, the trend which we can talk about -- right? MS. HILL: Right. REP. ROEMER: -- is quadrupling in the CTC budget. So why isn't more money put into analysts in that budget which is quadrupling? MS. HILL: I think it's a priority question. I mean, it's -- you know, as the -- and what we found and what we are saying is that the resources -- that we are getting more resources for counterterrorism prior to September 11th and after the DCI declared war on bin Laden it was going up. But there was no massive shift. It was a gradual thing. And in terms of the analysis, there was not a significant amount of resources dedicated to it. So I assume it is like every other resource allocation: it is depending on where your priorities are. And obviously there was not a big priority on the analysis. REP. ROEMER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. SEN. GRAHAM: Thank you, Mr. Roemer. Mr. LaHood. REP. LAHOOD: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ms. Hill, thank you for your service to our committee -- and to your staff too -- I know they've worked long hours. MS. HILL: That's very true, and they've done an excellent job. They really have. I agree with that. And to Kristen and Steve, thank you for -- if you are still here -- for being here -- and your testimony and the people that you represent. Obviously our hearts go out to all of you. Ms. Hill, if you take all the information that's in your report today and you analyze all that information, and then you look at the notion that there was a lot of information prior to 9/11, there were a lot of people in separate ways who saw it, and if you took that information and it was analyzed correctly, and the people responsible, whether it would be the president, the vice president, the national security advisor, the CIA director or FBI director -- if they had had all the information that you collected and documented in your report, could 9/11 have been prevented? If they had seen the Phoenix memo, if they had seen the memo from Minnesota. If they had seen -- really had all of these transits, these documents that had come over the transit for any number of days? I mean, there has to be some idea about -- because the criticism is that a lot of information came, but it wasn't shared; a lot of information was available, but wasn't shared, and the right people didn't know it. Well, if you take all that information, and if it had been shared with the highest elected people in our government and the highest appointed people in our government who have responsibility for counteracting these activities, could 9/11 have been prevented? MS. HILL: My own view is that I don't think anyone will ever be able to say -- no one will ever really know whether 9/11 could have been prevented, because what we are talking about here is we not only would have to know what everyone would have done with the information they had in the intelligence community in terms of law enforcement and intelligence, you would also have to know how bin Laden and the hijackers would have reacted. We don't know that. I mean, it's all -- we are hypothesizing. And there has been so much emphasis on was there a smoking gun, was there a -- when, where, how -- that sort of thing. We didn't find -- we haven't found that. What we have found is a lot of information, a lot of things that weren't put together. And to me maybe the biggest issue is, and we say it somewhat in the statement -- not only that they weren't put together, but they weren't recognizing the importance, given everything else they should have known for instance in the summer of 2001 -- that's the summer that you had Midhar, Alhazmi, you had Phoenix, you had Moussaoui, you had a high threat level. Well, you would think with all of that, when you got Phoenix or you got Moussaoui, it would have been even more -- you would have been more aggressive with it, and that didn't happen. So there's a lot of unknowns. There's questions whether people would have -- if you had caught hijacker would they have replaced him with someone else? There's questions about could you, if you had gotten onto one of these cases, could you have surveiled and perhaps found what was going on? All of those are hypotheticals, and we are never going to know. But I think what we do clearly know is that the community could have done a lot better on the intelligence side and the law enforcement side. REP. LAHOOD: But your answer is that the community could have done a lot better. But knowing what we know about information that was there -- and the dots were never connected in a lot of these different areas -- you are not saying though that the community could have prevented this. They could have done a lot better, but they couldn't have prevented -- MS. HILL: I'm saying they could have -- REP. LAHOOD: But they couldn't have prevented it? MS. HILL: No, I didn't say that. I never said they couldn't have. REP. LAHOOD: What I want to know -- I want you to be able to tell us pretty definitively here for these people that are here, that if all the dots were connected, and all the information was shared, and all the right people would have known it, could we have prevented 9/11? MS. HILL: I would say -- REP. LAHOOD: That's the criticism all over this town and all over the country and all over the world -- that we, you know, we collected a lot of information but it wasn't connected, that people didn't connect the dots, they didn't share the information. And my question is, and I think it's a question on the minds of the American people, if it had been done correctly, could it have been prevented. And people that are promoting a blue ribbon committee, which I am not, are saying that that's the way we get to the bottom line. But I want to know from you, who have been working at this now for several month, could it have been prevented? MS. HILL: I, I can't say guaranteed that it could have been prevented. There could have been some things done that there's possible that they might have been able to uncover some of this plot if they had had the information on individuals, and they had followed them and they had surveiled them. And the individuals had talked about something and they might have picked it up. I mean, all of those are ifs. It's one if after another. You're never going to know that, but if you don't get beyond the point that they could have done better, you know, that is what they have to do the next time. Because if they don't, you're not going to have a shot at preventing this the next time. That's where the issue is. Not so much preventing what's already happened. It's preventing what may happen in the future that we have to focus on. That's my own view. And I think to prevent what may happen in the future, there's a lot of things that have to be done to get us there. SEN. GRAHAM: Thank you, Mr. LaHood. Let me say, tomorrow we're going to have two panels with five persons in total, all of whom have had extensive experience at the highest level of actually making decisions based on intelligence. And I would suggest the question you just asked of Ms. Hill would be a very appropriate question to ask of those panelists to get their assessment of whether there was enough information from the experience and perspective that they had and can provide as to whether there was enough to have avoided September the 11th. Mr. Hoekstra. REP. PETER HOEKSTRA (R-MI): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I'd like to thank the chairmen for how they started off these public hearings, I believe, with Steve and Kristen today. It's a very appropriate way to begin the process by remembering those whose families paid the ultimate sacrifice on September 11 and recognizing the sense of urgency and the importance with which this committee has to go through and conduct its work. And, Ms. Hill, thank you for your work -- MS. HILL: Thank you. REP. HOEKSTRA: -- having gone through some other investigations on other committees, recognizing the importance of how you approach this work and the intensity and the professionalism and having to put up with members of Congress. So thank you for being willing to go through that process. As you've gone through and done the analysis, have you also taken a look at other attempted terrorist activities during this time frame which may have been prevented because of knowledge that we had beforehand and things that might not be part of the public record? Have you uncovered anything like that? MS. HILL: You mean other actions by other groups or other -- REP. HOEKSTRA: By al Qaeda or other groups that -- where they had been planning on attacking the United States and, for one reason or another, those attacks were thwarted? MS. HILL: We have heard some of that. I mean, we have not focused on that because we were focusing on the information on aircrafts as weapons and September 11th. But certainly, in talking to people, there were successes by the intelligence community against al Qaeda and other terrorist groups. There were also, you know, failures. REP. HOEKSTRA: Other failures. MS. HILL: So, I mean, it was -- and I think -- I didn't read that part, but in our statement we talk about the fact that they did -- that it was a very difficult target for the intelligence community. Al Qaeda had a lot of operational security. They were hard to penetrate. They were hard to get them to talk about things that would help you. It was difficult. There were resource problems. But despite all that, the community did amass a lot of information on them and they were engaged in operations against al Qaeda and there were some successes, but there were also some failures. REP. HOEKSTRA: As you go through this process, will you also overlay policy decisions that were made, either in Congress or at the executive level? Specifically, I think, this morning Steve talked about -- and I'm not sure exactly what the words were -- but the inability to penetrate organizations like al Qaeda with human intelligence and recognizing that during parts of the '90s, you know, there were decisions that were made that changed the way that the CIA and other organizations could actually recruit human intelligence. MS. HILL: I think that area -- I mean, those are all valid policy questions, and it's relevant to how you, you know, how you combat terrorism in groups like this, obviously, because penetrating a group like this is tremendously important. It's a valuable source of intelligence. But I think those are issues that we will probably address. As I understand the chairman, one of the things we want to do as we get further away from the facts -- we're trying to get the factual review out first. That is a systemic problem -- and then look at possible ways to reform the community and changes and policy issues and those sorts of things. So I would guess that those issues would be addressed once we get into where do we go from here in terms of reform. REP. HOEKSTRA: Because it's very, very clear that the intelligence community and the various agencies don't operate in a vacuum. There are policies and decisions that are made over a period of time that will have an impact on the culture within the various agencies as to their ability to recruit or how they will use or who they will access for human intelligence. There's also decisions that are made by Congress in terms of the funding levels and direction and those types of things. And, you know, as the report moves forward, we will get a fuller context of where the breakdowns will be, some of which may have occurred within the intelligence agencies, some of which may have occurred in other parts of the executive branch, or some of which may have occurred in Congress because of decisions that have been made over here, so that we get that full picture of what went on. MS. HILL: Right. REP. HOEKSTRA: That will all be -- those are all areas that you plan on looking at? MS. HILL: I mean, the game plan, so to speak, is to look at the factual review, get through that, then look at the systemic issues and then decide how those systemic issues can be addressed through reform. And what you're talking about, I think, would be in the systemic-issue problems, restrictions on our ability to penetrate human sources, hum- int, and then where we go from here in terms of reform. REP. HOEKSTRA: Good. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, I yield back my time. SEN. GRAHAM: Thank you very much. Senator Shelby. SEN. SHELBY: Thank you. Ms. Hill, I've missed some of this because, like everybody, we have to do other things during the meeting. Would it be fair to say at this point in the inquiry, the investigation, that we're a long way from finishing our inquiry, are we not? MS. HILL: I like to look at it -- I like to be optimistic rather than pessimistic. And I would say I think we've made a significant good start down the road. SEN. SHELBY: Well, I think we've -- MS. HILL: We're not finished but, you know, I think we've done a fair amount of work here and we're getting -- we have a good record on the facts so far. SEN. SHELBY: But you're a veteran investigator, a veteran prosecutor, inspector general at DOD. We all know this and we have a lot of respect for you. But in any investigation, you don't know what's going to turn up next, do you? MS. HILL: Right. SEN. SHELBY: And you're not telling us here today and the American people that you see the end of this investigation. MS. HILL: No, I think I said previously, in response to another question, that in any investigation, the more you dig, you find things, and then you have to have time to go through those things. SEN. SHELBY: Analyze it. MS. HILL: And we are -- that has happened. It's happening, just like it happens in any investigation. And we're trying to follow those facts where they lead. Now, whether all of that will be finished by whenever this is determined to end, I don't know. But I think we'll make a significant contribution and will have made a good -- SEN. SHELBY: I think you're already making a significant contribution, and I think the staff is. My concern is that we don't know what we don't know. MS. HILL: Correct. SEN. SHELBY: And I have the feeling that there's more out there, because I raised this morning -- I raised the issue in opening statements that I don't believe, as a member of the committee, that we've had the utmost support by the agencies that we're investigating. And I don't believe that we've had the support that was promised at the outset, you know, by the administration. Having said that, I want to focus just what little time I have on the FBI. You may have talked about this earlier -- I know you addressed it -- and that is the analytical component of the FBI. MS. HILL: Right. SEN. SHELBY: We know that the FBI has got good people. We know that they're great on investigations. They have no peer, I believe. MS. HILL: Right. SEN. SHELBY: But on analysis of intelligence information, some of us have been on the committee -- and this is my eighth year here -- that we've been concerned with that for a long time. It's hard to put an intelligence division or component together and make it work. Tell us, in your judgment, what was the state of the analytical component of the FBI before September the 11th, from what you know? MS. HILL: Well, on terrorism, basically, yeah. SEN. SHELBY: As far as terrorism is concerned. MS. HILL: The FBI -- I mean, our figures -- we have the figures in the statement -- they, I think, had one individual working on al Qaeda -- SEN. SHELBY: One individual working al Qaeda before September the 11th in the analysis. MS. HILL: Analysis, right. And, you know, my own personal view -- and you alluded to it -- and I have worked with the FBI for many, many years -- SEN. SHELBY: I know you have. MS. HILL: -- starting when I was a prosecutor, and I agree with you. I think they are tremendous investigators. And in terms of law enforcement, they can be the best on some cases in prosecutions. But that's their mission. Their mission is to do an investigation, to do a prosecution, to do a case. If it's their case and their mission, their prosecution, they will go to the nth degree. And they're very aggressive, and we need that. But they are not -- at least in my experience, their training and their mission does not focus on going beyond that into the broader analytical world and looking at the big picture. They are focused on their case. And it's too bad, because their aggressiveness would be very good if they could also channel it, at least on issues like terrorism, a little broader onto the analytical. SEN. SHELBY: Well, before September 11th, they only had one person in the whole bureau working on that, you just testified to. Is that correct? On al Qaeda. MS. HILL: Yeah. And I just have a note from our staff, who has done a lot of these interviews, that it was at the FBI they had one individual doing strategic analysis is what we're talking about. SEN. SHELBY: That's right. MS. HILL: They did have some others that were doing, as she calls, operational analysis, which I interpret that to mean that was connected with prosecutions and cases. So there were individuals doing that. SEN. SHELBY: Do we think that there is a way to get the FBI changed, or at least part of it, toward strategic analysis of information dealing with terrorism in the future? I know we talked to the director about this. But that's harder to do than it is to say, isn't it? MS. HILL: Well, I think it's not only getting them to expand their focus. I mean, it's like any job or profession in an agency. They have to be able to give people incentives in terms of career and profession and those sorts of things to make the analysis positions in the FBI important positions, that people want to do. SEN. SHELBY: One of my lights is on. I guess I'll -- I'll wait another round, Mr. Chairman. REP. GOSS: Ms. Pelosi. REP. PELOSI: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I want to join others in commending Ms. Hill on the excellent work that she and the members of her very able staff have performed. I hope, I hope that it is a comfort to the families to know how persistent and thorough this staff is in this investigation, in this inquiry, however limited it is strictly to intelligence. And as was mentioned earlier, there are other agencies of government beyond the intelligence community that need some review as well. The question of could it have been prevented, of course, is one that will haunt us as long as we exist as a country. And there's no good answer. The good news is the bad news. If the answer is no, it could not have been prevented, that means we're very exposed in the future. If it means yes, it could have been prevented, that's good news because that bodes well for the future, but it's a tragedy, obviously, for the families. It's a tragedy in any event, but if it could have been prevented, we'll all be haunted by the guilt associated with that. And that's not even good enough punishment for us. There will be hell to -- that's going up to September 11th. Post-September 11th, if any of these agencies of government in the intelligence community are not dealing honestly with us -- and by that I mean being forthcoming with information -- if, as Mr. Shelby says, there's other information to come that we don't know about now, I believe there will be hell to pay for them, because we all assume that everyone is doing their best to protect our country, and they must help us get to the bottom of this. I trust that they are helping us all they can, but we must continue the inquiry. I think, as one who originally supported an independent commission -- I was original author of it, and we passed in committee; we failed on the floor -- the idea, I think, is an important one. However, it does not in any way undermine the important work of this inquiry. As Mr. Roemer has said and others have said, this piece of it that goes into the intelligence committee is very important. We could have had the best intelligence in the world, though, and what we found out was that, since September 11th, is that the hijackers and the al Qaeda knew something about us that we did not know about ourselves, and that is that we had tremendous exposure at the airports. That all four of these hijackings could have been successful is remarkable. I find it remarkable that maybe one would get by, but four of them to succeed -- in their words succeed -- is remarkable to me. So my question to you, Ms. Hill, is, on this subject your report is clear, but I would just like to see if you could shed some further light. As you were looking into this issue of the hijackers -- and we'll go more into it in a couple of days -- but did you see a distinction made between hijacking -- of course, tat's a predictable threat to us -- and using airplanes as weapons as two distinct threats? Because from our perspective, many of us, a hijacking is still the loss of many, many lives and should have been taken as seriously as hijacking with intent to do further damage. MS. HILL: Well, we certainly, when we went out looking for information and requesting information from the agencies, distinguished it, because we were asking for information on the use of aircraft as weapons. So that would imply more than the usual just hijack a plane to get somewhere or take hostages or whatever. But in terms of, you know, being prepared to address it and your comments about why, you know, why they were able to hijack all four of these plans and our defenses were down, there's probably less of a distinction. And I point to the FAA-FBI assessment that we quote in this staff statement. I think that year, which was, I believe, 2000, they were looking at the whole threat, terrorist threat, to civil aviation. So they were not distinguishing between aircrafts as weapons or hijacking. And what was interesting about it is that they were concluding that there was a small domestic threat, so they were not too concerned about any sort of terrorist threat to domestic U.S. aviation here in the United States as late as 2000. REP. PELOSI: Well, I find that to be a serious shortcoming -- MS. HILL: Right. REP. PELOSI: -- separate and apart from not knowing the time and place and date -- MS. HILL: Right. REP. PELOSI: -- the fact that the entire threat was minimized to that extent. So I do see the need, as I had said before, to assess the performance of any agency beyond the intelligence agencies, which have a responsibility to (protect?) acts of terrorism and to look with fresh eyes and some innovative thinking on our intelligence and all other aspects of protecting the American people in this regard. And, of course, as Senator Rockefeller said, we must do it right. But I think doing it right also means protecting our civil liberties. So we have quite a challenge. And your presentation this morning and the work of your staff has been a valuable contribution. Thank you. MS. HILL: Thank you. REP. PELOSI: I look forward to following hearings. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. SEN. GRAHAM: Thank you, Ms. Pelosi. Mr. Goss. REP. GOSS: Thank you. Let me advise members of the House that there's 10 minutes left on a vote in the House, so my wrap-up will be very quick. First of all, I want to thank Ms. Hill for a very excellent presentation. MS. HILL: Thank you. REP. GOSS: I liked the version that we had before it had been redacted better, and I expect that we are going to continue to press on, because I do believe that there is more that can be revealed. And along that area, is it fair for me to make a statement that because of the joint staff, we now know some things that we otherwise certainly would not have known? Is that a fair statement? MS. HILL: I would hope so, yes. I would say so. REP. GOSS: That is certainly my feeling as well. And I hope that much of that can be shared with the American people. The second question I wanted to ask or provide some guidance on, from my perspective, is in your excellent report this morning on intelligence reporting on bin Laden's intentions to strike inside the United States, on pages 14 and 15 of your report -- 15 and 16 -- were a series of specifics that cries out to say, ""Why was all this ignored? Where was the audience? Why was nobody listening?"" And one of the issues that I would like to have further amplification on this is if this was 2 percent of the reporting, what was the other 98 percent of the reporting that was consuming the analysts' time in the intelligence community? I'm not asking for an answer now. MS. HILL: Right. REP. GOSS: I think that is going to be helpful for our report. The next question, I think, is self-evident, and others have said it. There's no doubt that some of the questions members here have addressed today to you are more appropriate for witnesses that will be forthcoming, and I want to make sure that we understand that there will be other witnesses forthcoming and we will try and have as much of that as public as we can, as it should be. But the very penetrating questions that were asked by Ms. Breitweiser and Mr. Push and the recommendations, I think, are an excellent point, and each one of them deserves consideration, and we'll get them at some point. In fact, some of them have already been given consideration, as I'm sure you know. And finally, with regard to the remarks about Senator Levin and Senator Rockefeller on declassification, my view is that the burden is on the administration to tell us why we must preserve classification unless it's in those areas, those exempt areas that I spoke to -- sources, methods, plans and intentions, and ongoing prosecutions by the Justice Department. The final point I would make is that the work of this committee will be done. There is no question about that. And there will continue to be oversight by the United States Congress in a number of areas, including in the intelligence committees, no matter who the members are of that committee. So this is an issue that is not going to be dropped merely because another date flips up on a calendar or there is a change of personnel somewhere in the establishment. This will go forward because the American people deserve the answer and they will get the answer. And I thank you very much for your participation today, and an excellent job, Ms. Hill. MS. HILL: Thank you. REP. GOSS: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. SEN. GRAHAM: Thank you, Mr. Goss. Senator Feinstein. SEN. FEINSTEIN: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I certainly concur with the remarks that have been made about the excellence of the report. MS. HILL: Thank you. SEN. FEINSTEIN: I'm just sorry I couldn't get it until the meeting, so I had to spend my time reading it during the meeting, which, Mr. Chairman, I would suggest is not the best way of enabling us to carry out our duties. SEN. GRAHAM: Senator, as you know, we made the original non- redacted version available in both the House and the Senate Intelligence Committee rooms, and I understand that you took advantage of that. Unfortunately, it was only within the last less than 36 hours that we got back from the declassification agencies the version that we could make public. I hope that in the future we and they will do a better job and a more expeditious job so that will give us an opportunity to know what's going to be public with more lead time. SEN. FEINSTEIN: I thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ms. Hill, on December the 4th, 1998, the DCI told his deputies, in a memo about bin Laden and al Qaeda, that ""We are at war. I want no resources or people spared in this effort, either inside CIA or the community."" Yet in your testimony, you indicate that when it came time to translate that declaration of war into real resources, the government's efforts fell woefully short. Specifically you concluded that the allocation of intelligence community resources did not adequately reflect the true war against bin Laden. For example, you point out in 1999 the CTC at CIA had only three analysts assigned to the bin Laden network worldwide. And after 2000, that number had risen to just five and that things were even worse outside the CIA. The international terrorism analytic unit at the FBI had in place only one analyst to address al Qaeda -- this out of an intelligent budget of literally billions of dollars every year. Now, it really concerns me, because I was one that felt very strongly that the warnings that something was going to happen were there, and certainly by July I was -- just based on what I heard in this committee -- 100 percent certain that something was going to happen. I even said that on national television, that I thought it was going to happen within the next three months. And my question really goes to the fact that whether today even we have enough to do what we need to do -- why do you think so little attention, even after these declarations of war, were really paid when it came to devoting real resources, and what was taking a higher priority? MS. HILL: I -- I think -- we have asked that to many people in the community, and I will give you -- again, I have to be careful the details of it, because we are in a public session. But I think what we are hearing is that there were other priorities that the intelligence -- one reaction would be that people would tell you that the intelligence community responds to its customers -- customers being other parts of government that are tasking them to come up with intelligence on certain items, and that in some respects there were customers that they had to satisfy, they felt they had to satisfy and were told to satisfy on other topics other than al Qaeda. So that was one issue that we've heard. We have heard in the FBI on this -- the resources. There was -- as we just discussed with Senator Shelby, there was not many -- there was like one strategic analyst for al Qaeda in the FBI. There were some more analysts on operations, and there was a much bigger emphasis in the FBI on operations, on cases, investigations, as opposed to strategic analysis, even though it was on al Qaeda, which was a high threat. But their mission was more focused on actual prosecutions and cases. So I think as with any resource issue it was a question of other priorities, customers demanding other things, and the agencies responding to them. SEN. FEINSTEIN: Do you believe that today there are sufficient resources? MS. HILL: We have not, senator -- you know, we know some of the details as to how things have jumped since September 11th in terms of resources, but we have not focused intently on what is going on post- September 11th, because our job has been to try and find out what was happening before September 11th. So I wouldn't -- I really would not feel probably qualified to start guessing as to whether it's adequate now. SEN. FEINSTEIN: On page 15 -- SEN. GRAHAM: Senator, we will have another round after this round. SEN. FEINSTEIN: I don't even get the time our question took up. Never mind. Thank you. SEN. GRAHAM: Senator Mikulski. SEN. MIKULSKI: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, a few words to the families and then a question for Ms. Hill. To the families, first of all, my name is Barbara Mikulski. I am a United States senator, and I am from the state of Maryland. I had people die at the World Trade Center, and I also had 60 Marylanders die at the Pentagon in the plane and in the inferno there. I also believe I owe my life to the gallantry of the men and women who fought on 93, because I do believe the plane was heading towards us. And I have two constituents who died in the anthrax attack on us. So know that I am absolutely on your side. And I want you to know that I thank you today for coming, because you show such inspirational strength and courage, and I believe you have a right to know about what happened, you have a right to be heard in any public forum, and I believe Americans have a right to be protected. I know that you are still looking for answers on why this happened, how it happened, and how it doesn't happen again. Know I would support a vote to establish an independent commission. I believe my committee has done an outstanding job. But I believe when such an impact happens to America and its families, we need more than one opinion on how to make sure it never happens again. What I find -- I find many things about what happened troubling. But what I find most troubling is that four of the terrorists were stopped by local law enforcement -- four for speeding, and one for not having a driver's license. They were actually in the hands of law enforcement. But when they were stopped, and the police went to check the databases, nothing alerted them to detain these men. Something is wrong here. State troopers, like the one in my own state that stopped one of these thugs, and other police officers know more when they check their database, know more about men being behind in their child support -- the database will tell them -- than they do about men who are possibly around a terrorist attack. There are more than 50 different watch lists to keep track of people dangerous to the United States. But, guess what, if you are a watch list, you don't talk to other watch lists. If you are a watch list, you like live in one of those caves. You might not know if there are other watch lists out there. You don't tell anyone that you are a watch list, and you certainly don't talk to each other, make friends with the other watch list, or make friends with law enforcement. That's really I think unacceptable. And these will be the questions I am going to direct to Ms. Hill, because like you I want to be sure that this committee gets answers for you and the rest of America on how we can detect, deter, disrupt and defeat any attack on the United States of America. And, having said that, Ms. Hill, you know about these watch lists -- you know that they are all over the place and they are nowhere. In our work with you and my colleagues, I wanted to see if there was a smoking gun. I wanted to know what were the systemic problems and what were the solutions. I am not sure there is a smoking gun, but these watch lists are definitely a systemic problem. Could you elaborate them, the ones you can, or where you would see solutions are going on the watch lists? MS. HILL: The watch list issue, senator, we are -- I am aware of it. We are going to go into that in more detail when we get to the hearing on the hijackers, because as you alluded to that is an issue regarding Midhar and Alhamzi. I mean, that's a very big issue. It's an issue of getting it on the right watch list, getting it to the right people. But, even before that, it's also an issue of getting it between the intelligence community and the law enforcement community, and breaking down the reluctance sometimes to share information across the -- from the intelligence community to the criminal investigators and law enforcement on the other side. And that I think may also play on some of this. So, but those are issues that we will talk about when we look at the hijacker case. And, you are right, they are a problem. SEN. MIKULSKI: Well, let me just say this before the yellow goes to red: I raised the issue of a smoking gun. I have been in many hearings. Do you believe that there is a smoking gun on what went wrong, or was it just a series of total disconnects? MS. HILL: Well, we -- of course I am handicapped in answering that, because we are in a public session and we are still looking at a number of other issues that have come up. But I don't think in any of what we have seen here, smoking gun -- if you mean by smoking gun that somebody had information of when, where, how this was going to happen in the United States government -- we have not found that. But, you know, I had a discussion -- actually with one of our staff -- on this the other day, and he pointed out wisely that there has been so much discussion about looking for a smoking gun. The truth is you hardly ever get a, quote, ""smoking gun"" in not just terrorism, but in a criminal case, et cetera, et cetera. And if by focusing all the time on we have the smoking gun, you know, we have to be ready to go if we have a smoking gun, the truth is most of the time you will never have a smoking gun, and it is a lot harder to find it when you don't have one. So what we ought to be focusing on is how to get our system ready to find these guys when you don't have a smoking gun, which is what you are going to be faced with most of the time, just -- you know, the odds are you are not going to have that. And we need to have our intelligence and law enforcement people good enough and bright enough and aggressive enough that they can track these guys down and find this, even when there is no smoking gun, because my own experience at least in law enforcement is that's what you have most of the time. SEN. MIKULSKI: Thank you. SEN. GRAHAM: Thank you, senator. Senator Kyl. And Senator Kyl has submitted an opening statement which will be placed in the record. SEN. KYL: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. By the way, I think that last point is a very important point that needs to be underscored, and it's one of the most important things that comes from this -- from your statement today, Ms. Hill. MS. HILL: Thank you, senator. SEN. KYL: I was this morning detained in my office waiting for a couple of phone calls, but I had my television on the entire time, and was privileged to hear not only the statements of the chairman of our committee, but also the statements made by Ms. Breitweiser and Mr. Push. And as has been expressed by others here, my heart goes out to them and the families and families that they represent. And I think that I should state that I am certain that every American shares their grief and their anger, and even their frustration. And I also share their view that there's more we could have done to try to prevent the terrorism we experienced on September 11th. I also agree with Eleanor Hill that at the end of the day it is doubtful we will ever find a smoking gun. But, as she said, the important point is to be in a better position to deal with the other pieces of information in order to try to prevent this in the future. I do think, Mr. Chairman, that it is very unclear whether the joint investigation -- the joint committee investigation that we are engaged in here, and whatever report we eventually submit will satisfy these witnesses and those that they represent, or whether they will satisfy members of this committee, let alone the other members of the House and the Senate. As you know, Mr. Chairman, I have expressed serious reservations about the direction of our investigation, including the allocation of time and resources to holding open hearings at this time before we have finished our work. Ours is a large undertaking, and we have got a lot more work to do before our fast-approaching deadline. And yet we are proceeding with public hearings, in spite of not having completed that investigation. What was presented today was only a staff document -- I am talking now about the testimony of Ms. Hill. It was not a consensus product. The committee members had no practical input into this interim report -- I think the public should know. Ordinarily we investigate, we write our report, and then we present our recommendations. The staff's presentation of its interim report before member vetting is therefore in my view premature as well as a diversion of the joint staff from the investigation that we have given them the job to do. The interim statement from our joint inquiry staff provides some very valuable information about what has been done to date -- a chronology of events leading to the September 11th attacks and some background information about the growing threat of al Qaeda over the last decade. It is very useful to have this history, and it's important to make it public. But the committee should have approved it first. And in any event, the release of the report could have been done without taking the time to have it read by the staff director. But, more importantly, I believe that questions fundamental to our investigation have yet to be pursued adequately. These include -- include, but are not limited to -- whether part of the pre-September 11th problem was a result of a culture of risk aversion in the intelligence community, and/or an inadequate allocation and improper prioritization of resources to those on the front lines of our counterterror efforts. Mr. Chairman, you know I have expressed before my concern that committee members have been able to play only a limited role in this inquiry. It's largely being conducted by the joint committee staff with little input by or to our own committee staffs, let alone the members themselves. And that will make it difficult to concur in the final product without reservations. We will not know what we haven't been told; and therefore we will not be able to vouch unequivocally for the final product. Questions about this investigative process have led to calls for the creation of a national commission to investigate all of these matters. This would further stress the intelligence community at the very time we are trying to fight the war on terrorism. While it may be deemed necessary, it can hardly be deemed desirable. So I hope, Mr. Chairman, that we can continue to work to resolve these issues. Only by doing our very best will we have done our duty to the victims who are represented here today, and to the American people. SEN. GRAHAM: Senator, thank you. Senator Bayh is supposed to be en route. If Senator Shelby has -- SEN. SHELBY: If you will let me ask until he comes. SEN. GRAHAM: And then I have a couple of questions I am going to ask at the conclusion of Senator Bayh's questions. Senator Shelby. SEN. SHELBY: Mrs. Hill, I would like to go back to the FBI and the analytical component we were talking about earlier -- MS. HILL: Right, right. SEN. SHELBY: -- or lack thereof. In your investigation regarding the analytical ability of the FBI, do you know if the FBI prior to September the 11th ever did an analysis of terrorist tactics? That is, terrorist tactics with the possible use of airplanes as weapons? MS. HILL: I don't believe so. We -- as I think -- SEN. SHELBY: You're saying no -- MS. HILL: As the statement says, we haven't found any analysis of the use of aircraft as weapons in the community, as far as I know, including the FBI. SEN. SHELBY: In the community -- you are talking about the intelligence community -- MS. HILL: Yeah, but we would include -- SEN. SHELBY: Not just the FBI? MS. HILL: Right. I think it's safe to say the FBI also. SEN. SHELBY: Now, in your statement -- I believe it's on page 28 -- not without reading it all -- and I'll quote some of it. It says, ""In April 2000, the intelligence community obtained information regarding an alleged bin Laden threat to hijack a 747. The source was a walk-in to the FBI's Newark office, claiming that he had been to a training camp in Pakistan, where he learned hijacking techniques and received arms training. He also stated that he was supposed to meet five or six other individuals in the U.S. who would participate in the plot."" And I'll read further: ""They were instructed to use all necessary force to take over the plane, because there would be pilots among the hijacking team. The plan was to fly the plane to Afghanistan, and if they could not make it there they would blow up the plane."" This is part of your report -- is that right? MS. HILL: Right. SEN. SHELBY: Now, were they -- I believe there was another report, August 2001, according to page 28 of your report, ""In August of 2001, the intelligence community obtained information regarding a plot to either bomb the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi from an airplane, or crash an airplane into it. The intelligence community learned that two people who were reportedly acting on instructions from bin Laden met in October 2000 to discuss this plot."" And then we go back and you've touched on this, I believe. I know we've had hearings on it. About the Philippine '95 situation. MS. HILL: Right. SEN. SHELBY: Where there was information that they could use airplanes as weapons and so forth. MS. HILL: Right, correct. SEN. SHELBY: In the light of part of your statement I just referred to , you're saying that they're -- according to your investigation, there was not any analysis of these terrorist tactics in the intelligence community, regarding the -- MS. HILL: There was no -- there was no analysis of the likelihood of the use of airplanes as weapons as a terrorist tactic. SEN. SHELBY: I wonder why not. MS. HILL: I would hypothesize that what -- I mean when we we've asked questions of people. It's a resource issue. People say they were overwhelmed. The other thing, and I mentioned this earlier, I don't think anyone had pulled as we did, I mean the reason, the way we got this information is by going to the agencies and saying we want everything you have on the use of aircraft as weapons. So we have then pulled out of this huge amount of data they have and come up with enough to show that there was this trend and this theme going through some of the reporting. SEN. SHELBY: This was not on September 11th something new or shouldn't have been something new. This was stuff that had been out there at least since '95, before then, and I believe you talked about the Paris incident where the French -- MS. HILL: The Eiffel Tower. SEN. SHELBY: Oh, yeah, the Eiffel Tower deal, the Philippine deal, these reporting that you listed. So when people come up and they say, ""Gosh, we were shocked that they would use weapons, use airplanes as weapons, and we didn't do any analysis of that in the community,"" are you kind of shocked or surprised? MS. HILL: Well, it was there. I mean, the information was there. SEN. SHELBY: The information was there if they had it analyzed as far as the potential tactics of the hijackers, is that right? MS. HILL: Yeah. I mean, based on what we've seen this was not a new idea as of September 11th. SEN. SHELBY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. SEN. GRAHAM: Senator Durbin. SEN. RICHARD DURBIN (D-IL): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I apologize for not being here earlier, but I had a Judiciary Committee hearing, which ran in conflict with this hearing today. And I thank you, Mr. Chairman, Senator Shelby and our counterparts in the House for the time that we put into this effort and your leadership in bringing us to this moment. I personally feel that we have identified some things of value in terms of shortcomings from the government's point of view prior to September 11th. We have identified a lack of communication among the intelligence agencies, and I'm afraid that today, although there's been an improvement, there is still much room for improvement. I have focused primarily on the issue of information technology and I have been chagrined and disappointed by the reports about the lack of coordination of the computer architecture of the federal government so that agencies, intelligence agencies can share information effectively. Governor Ridge referred to this as a force multiplier, and it would be, but it is not because of those shortcomings. We have also considered the results of those shortcomings, and not the least of which was the example of the Phoenix memo, which should have been but was not brought to the attention of or analyzed by counter-terrorism forces. That memo might -- might have at least helped us to be better prepared for what occurred on September 11th, though I don't want to suggest that anyone saw this coming in its specifics, but it's certainly raised questions, which should have been pursued and were not. I think recalling some of the testimony we received there was clearly a lack of follow-up at the FBI and a lack of involvement by the CIA. The same thing holds true for the Moussaoui arrest and the disclosures that came out of the FBI afterwards, again evidencing a lack of coordination, a lack of sharing of vital information that could have had us better prepared to defend America. Those two instances though I would like to bring to the attention of this joint inquiry have come to the public eye because of leaks, leaks by the administration, leaks from Capitol Hill of vital information. It strikes me as unwise and unfair for us to expect there to be a thorough investigation of what led up to September 11th based on the possibility of leaks coming from anywhere. History has told us that it is far better to have a public hearing, a public investigation and the involvement of third parties when it comes to assigning blame and perhaps suggesting meaningful and painful reforms, but that has not been the case here. I think we are doing what we set out to do, to try to find ways to improve the workings of the intelligence community to avoid a future September 11th, but we will never be able to satisfy the needs and curiosity of the American people about whether their government did everything it could to protect them in closed hearings with occasional leaks. That is not going to serve the needs of America. (Applause.) I know that earlier today there was testimony of one of the widows of a victim of September 11th and I have met in my office with some of those same victims and the families in painful meetings. There is an anger and a sadness in the message that they bring to Congress, but there is certainly I think wisdom in what they've suggested: Let us do our business here, let us try to find even within closed hearings ways to improve the intelligence committee and community, but let's not forget our primary obligation to the people of this country. We do not serve the needs of an open society with closed hearings in relation to an attack on America virtually unprecedented in our history. It is time for us to acknowledge the obvious: We need a third party investigation, people that we can trust, who have no political animus, who are going to come to this as loyal Americans to try to help us be a safer nation. I commend the staff. They have done heroic work and I know have worked long and hard to bring the report that we have today. And we should continue to meet our mandate as best we can, but let us not believe that this chapter has been closed in American history. We have merely addressed the forward with this investigation; now we must get into the substance and do it in a public way. That's not to diminish any of the efforts of my colleagues or anyone on this committee, but I think we owe it to the American people to give them more. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. SEN. GRAHAM: I would like to ask a question and then make a comment. The question has to do with the relationship between intelligence and effecting the operation of a governmental agency. You have five or more pages in which you outline the examples of the use of commercial aviation as a weapon of mass destruction. As I understand the history, generally the taking of an airplane by hijackers has been done for either a political or an economic purpose, that in light of that the standard protocol, what a crew is supposed to do if they are subjected to hijacking is to cooperate, to acquiesce, to try to get the airplane on the ground and then start the process of negotiating with the hijackers. From your review, is that an accurate statement? MS. HILL: Yes, I think that's correct, and that was traditionally the way you would deal with a hijacking. SEN. GRAHAM: And I believe it was reflected in the way in which the first three planes that were hijacked on September 11th reacted. It was not until the information of the first three planes became known to the persons on the fourth plane that there was a resistance to the hijackers and as a result the plane crashed in Pennsylvania. With the kind of intelligence information that there might be a shift in the way in which hijackers and aircraft interrelated, that is instead of taking the airplane for a political or economic purpose, that the plane itself might be converted into a weapon and used in the horrific manner that it was. Was that information from the intelligence community transmitted to either the FAA or the commercial aviation industry so that it might affect the way in which they advise crews as to how to respond to a hijacking? MS. HILL: I can't say that all that information was transmitted to the FAA. The FAA did get some of it, and we talk about their analysis of the threat to civil aviation. My own read on it is I don't think that to the extent the FAA got the information there was a real recognition that this was a serious threat. I mean, certainly you're correct. I mean, if they had changed their focus from hijacking for ransom or to take the plane and fly it somewhere else or hostages or whatever, if that had changed to the use of an aircraft as a weapon, you would have had to change the entire mindset and training that was given to the flight crews, for instance, and the security in the plane and everything, and that obviously did not happen because as of September 11th, you're absolutely correct, it didn't happen on September 11th until evidently the passengers in the fourth plane became aware of what was going on, but that was not, the flight crews up to that point I assume were following the standard protocol for dealing with a hijacking. But that issue underscores the importance of someone recognizing in the community, the intelligence community that this was a serious threat and there was a stream of information there and that perhaps it was serious enough and the likelihood was serious enough that they needed to address not only disseminating it but telling policymakers in those other agencies that this was a threat they now had to be prepared to meet. SEN. GRAHAM: One of my criticisms of the threats that are being issued to the general public, including the one within the last two weeks, is that what's lacking is the follow-on of what is the citizen who receives this information that they're living in a heightened threat environment supposed to do to protect themselves, their families, their communities. And here we have a case of where intelligence information was sent to a sophisticated industry, commercial aviation apparently without any direction as to how the industry should use the information and the consequence was they didn't use the information and that contributed to what happened on September 11th. I'd like to ask if we might pursue that issue, because I think it is a metaphor for the larger issue of how do you get intelligence from the theoretical to actually affecting the way people function and how they use that information to reduce their vulnerability to a particular threat. Senator Feinstein? SENATOR FEINSTEIN: I think Senator DeWine was before me, Mr. Chairman. SEN. GRAHAM: Oh, I'm sorry. Senator DeWine. I'm sorry. SEN. DEWINE: Mr. Chairman, I don't have any further questions. Thank you. SEN. GRAHAM: Senator Feinstein? SEN. FEINSTEIN: May I, Mr. Chairman? Ms. Hill? MS. HILL: Yes, Senator. SEN. FEINSTEIN: I wanted to kind of follow-up on where I was trying to go with this. The year 2001 was a very big year in the early spring with a lot of pieces of intelligence coming in. In reading your report, the year 1998 also appears to have been a very big year for all kinds of pieces. And I wanted to see if we couldn't go into some of those pieces a little bit more. There contained on page 15 on your written statement you talk about the use of fronts for terrorist activities, talk about flying an aircraft loaded with explosives into an airport and detonating it. Al-Qaeda was trying to establish an operative cell within the United States. A bin Laden plot involving aircraft in New York and Washington. Recruiting a group of five to seven young men from the United States to travel to the Middle East for training. Reward money for assassinations of four top intelligence agency officers and on like that. And then, of course the war that was declared in the CIA. MS. HILL: Right. SEN. FEINSTEIN: Can you go into any more detail on any of these individual pieces of intelligence and how they were used from an intelligence perspective to try to weave an intelligence web? Because it seems to me with this and then unfortunately in July of 2001 with the Phoenix memo and then in August with Moussaoui, and I don't know what was in his computer or in his possession, but I would suggest if you took those pieces and the other pieces one might be able to weave together a rather significant scheme. Can you give us any more information? MS. HILL: I can't. I don't think I can give you more information on the actual report because, as I mentioned at the outset, the language that we have in this statement is what has been declassified. So to venture beyond that language, that is the language that the declassification group basically signed off on as suitable for public release. I can't go into much more detail about the language of the report. We did go on some of these to the FBI and asked them what they did with some of this information or what happened to it when the report came in, if they got it, and I can tell you some of them, and we've given them a whole list, and some we still have not gotten responses. They are still trying to find out what they did or locate the record. Others they have found. For instance, I think you mentioned the 1998 information concerning a bin Laden plot involving aircraft in New York and Washington. The FBI, I can tell you, did receive that information and they worked actually with local law enforcement to try to verify the report, but they were not able to corroborate the report and took no further action is what we have been told. In September '98 we had one where we did get a response from the FBI. This was the one about that they obtained information that bin Laden's next operation could involve flying an aircraft loaded with explosives into a U.S. airport and detonating it. We asked the FBI if they got that information and what did they do with it. They did receive the information and they also worked with another agency, government agency to try to verify the information. The source of the information said that another individual had advanced knowledge of some of bin Laden's operations and had given him the information about bin Laden's attack or this report. The FBI tells us that they tried to work with other agencies and did verify portions of this account, but they were not able to locate the individual who reportedly had the advanced knowledge. And after September 11th they actually went back to this report and tried to locate that individual again and were unable to do so. So what we tried to do when we got these reports that we felt were significant was we tried -- particularly the ones, there were many in 1998 involving domestic U.S. attacks and on those we went back to the FBI, as I said, and have asked them, ""Did you get the report, what did you do to verify it or did you take any action,"" and they have come back to us on some of them. Some of them, there are a number of them, they are still trying to go through their records and come up with an answer as to whether they got it and if so what they did with it. But those two are examples of the type of thing we're getting from them. SEN. FEINSTEIN: Thank you. Mr. Chairman, just one quick comment, if I might. I think this report becomes kind of a basic primer on 9/11. I'm sure more will be filled in as time goes on, but I find it a very valuable document in establishing a chronology of what was known, when it was known, the fragmentary messages that come through here and my hope is as these hearings go on and particularly when we get to the Phoenix memo and the Moussaoui case that we might be able to ask some questions and I don't know in public session if we will about if there had been a FISA warrant on Moussaoui and the information made available, whether that would have been substantial enough to really ring a very strong bell. But I wanted to thank the staff and Ms. Hill and also thank the victims who were here today. It's very special and I hope you know that we really do care and that you really do have our sympathy and our determination to get at the heart of it. SEN. GRAHAM: And, Senator, I share those comments and I would say that within the next week or ten days we will have a further specific hearing on the issues that surround the Moussaoui case and that would be a very excellent opportunity to bore in at the level of detail that you've indicated your interested in. I didn't get a chance in my first round to make my comments, so I will do so unless anyone -- does anyone have any remaining questions? So this will be the last word. To me, one of the lessons that we have been learning and today we learned it at a new depth is how difficult it is to get an organization, which has been doing its business, important business in a particular pattern for an extended period of time, to be flexible enough to recognize that the environment has shifted and it is going to have to change its pattern of business. In the case of the intelligence agencies they were a child born in 1947 and grew up in the Cold War. Every experience that the U.S. intelligence service had was a post-1947 experience because we didn't have any civilian intelligence service in the United States prior to 1947. I contrast that with, for instance, the British who have had an intelligence service since the Napoleonic Wars. So it is not surprising that when the Cold War ended the agencies continued to act pretty much the way they did while the Cold War was still underway because that was the only environment in which they'd ever functioned or known. We've had some examples I think in the report that Ms. Hill has given us today, the difficulty in reestablishing priority. Even though we declared that terrorism and Osama bin Laden specifically was such an adversary that we were at war with him, we didn't change resources commensurate with that decision. We did not recognize that terrorism was now becoming a domestic threat because historically we thought of terrorism as something that happened abroad and the new creative uses that the hijackers were about to make of commercial airliners. No longer were they passive instruments to try to use to secure money or some political advantage; they had themselves become a weapon of mass destruction. So I see as one of our challenges as we move from what we are learning to what we are going to prescribe for the future is to how can we build in to our intelligence community a greater capability of internal adapting. We certainly don't want to leave this issue for the future that will require a repetition of September the 11th to get to grab us by the sleeves and say, you know, you've got to change because your old ways are threatening the security of the American people. And how we go about doing that I suggest will be one of our major tasks, and if we are successful one of our major accomplishments. If there is no further statement, as I indicated earlier, the record will be open for 48 hours if anyone has any additional material they would like to submit. I want to especially thank the families who are represented here today and especially to Kristen, who I see is still with us and also Stephen for their excellent presentations, which started our public hearings with the appropriate recognition of why we are here, and we are here because of you. Thank you. SEN. SHELBY: Mr. Chairman, what's the schedule for the rest of the week? SEN. GRAHAM: Ms. Hill, do you want to review tomorrow? MS. HILL: I believe tomorrow we are going to have a public hearing in this room beginning at 10:00 and there will be two panels of users of intelligence products from the intelligence community and those users will be senior government officials over several administrations. I believe tomorrow we will have Mr. Wolfowitz, the deputy secretary of defense, Mr. Armitage, the deputy secretary of state, Brent Scowcroft, former National Security Advisory, Tony Lake, former National Security Advisory, and Sandy Berger, former National Security Advisor. SEN. SHELBY.: Will we start at 10:00? MS. HILL: 10:00. SEN. GRAHAM: We'll start at 10:00 and assuming that the stars line up properly and we can accomplish this, our goal would be to complete the first panel, which will be Mr. Wolfowitz and Mr. Armitage, in approximately three hours, have a break and then return at 2:30 and have the second panel run approximately another -- I'm corrected. The second panel is going to start at 2:00 so that we can try to finish at approximately 5:00 with both panels. MS. HILL: That's correct. SEN. GRAHAM: Are we at a point, Ms. Hill, we can comment on Friday yet? MS. HILL: I think we're still engaged in ongoing discussions on Friday. SEN. GRAHAM: Okay, thank you. The hearing is adjourned.
